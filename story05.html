Summary<br><br>

Over the next twenty years, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) and defense budget could
grow to exceed those of the United States, allowing it to become a true peer competitor. Despite
this potential, we believe China’s security interests and military capabilities will remain focused
on its immediate periphery. Possible conflicts might arise there involving Korea, Taiwan, one
or more countries of Southeast Asia, or India, more or less in that descending order of probability.
A U.S.-China conflict might also start in―and perhaps be entirely confined to―cyberspace.
We do not assess armed conflict between the United States and China as probable in
any of these instances, but that judgment is based on an assessment that the United States will
retain the capacity to deter behavior that would lead to such a clash.<br><br>
American ground forces will be essential for the most likely East Asia contingency, that
arising from a Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) collapse, but less so for the
others. While China’s overall military capabilities will not equal those of the United States
anytime soon, it will more quickly achieve local superiority in its immediate neighborhood,
first in and around Taiwan and then at somewhat greater distances. In consequence, the direct
defense of contested assets in that region will become progressively more difficult, eventually
approaching impossible. The United States will therefore become increasingly dependent on
escalatory options for defense and retaliatory capabilities for deterrence. American nuclear
superiority is not likely to be much help in this regard, both because China will retain a
second-strike capability and because the issues at stake in most potential crises are not of vital
consequence to the United States. Conflict is likely to escalate into the cyber and economic
realms. In both cases, U.S. vulnerabilities are such as to make this unattractively costly. Conventional
strikes on mainland Chinese military targets may be the best escalatory option, but
there is little reason to be confident that conflict could be so confined.<br><br>
One means of improving the prospects for direct defense and reducing the risk of escalation
is for the United States to enable the capabilities and buttress the resolve of China’s neighbors.
Such a strategy should not be―or be seen―as a U.S. attempt to encircle or align the
region against China, lest it produce greater Chinese hostility. Indeed, a parallel effort should
be made to draw China into cooperative security endeavors, not only to avoid the appearance
of an anti-China coalition but also to obtain greater contributions to international security
from the world’s second-strongest power.<br><br>
The economic consequences of a Sino-American conflict could be historically unparalleled,
even if both sides avoid economic warfare. This is a powerful mutual deterrent, one marginally
in the American favor at present. Strengthening the U.S. economy is the best way of
ensuring that the balance of interdependence and of the associated deterrence does not shift
dangerously against the United States over the next several decades.<br><br>
While the risk of conflict with China cannot be ignored, neither should it be exaggerated.
Any number of other conflicts are more likely. These more likely conflicts will be with
opponents quite different from China and will call for capabilities quite dissimilar from those
required to deal with a real peer competitor. Individually, these contingencies will be less consequential
than a conflict with China, but collectively they will shape the international environment
in which both countries interact and fundamentally influence Chinese perceptions of
U.S. power and determination.<br><br>

Over the next twenty years, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) and defense budget could
exceed those of the United States.1 If it chose, China could therefore become a more capable
opponent than either the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany at their peak. Yet China is seeking
neither territorial aggrandizement nor ideological sway over its neighbors. It shows no interest
in matching U.S. military expenditures, achieving a comparable global reach, or assuming
defense commitments beyond its immediate periphery. Such intentions might change, but if
so, the United States would probably receive considerable warning, given the lead times needed
to develop such capabilities.<br><br>
Despite cautious and pragmatic Chinese policies, the risk of conflict with the United
States remains, and this risk will grow in consequence and perhaps in probability as China’s
strength increases. Below we review the sources of conflict we believe most likely to occasion
a China-U.S. military clash over the next thirty years, arrayed in descending order of probability.
All are on China’s immediate periphery, where we believe Chinese security interests
and capabilities will remain focused. We do not believe a China-U.S. military conflict to be
probable in any of the cases, but that judgment is based on the view that the United States
will retain the capacity to deter behavior that could lead to such a clash throughout this period.
After reviewing the plausible sources of conflict, we turn to the operational implications these
scenarios might present the United States and the resultant requirements for defense and deterrence.
We examine the capabilities the United States will need to maintain to ensure that a
conflict with China does not occur, and conclude with thoughts on America’s long-term strategy
for dealing with the challenges posed by a rising China.<br><br>

1 China’s economy is expected to grow at roughly twice the rate of the American over the next fifteen years. At market
exchange rates, China’s GDP is about 40 percent of the U.S. GDP, and RAND estimates that by 2025 it will be about half.
China currently commits about 2.5 percent of its GDP to defense expenditures, roughly half the current American rate.
Although Chinese defense spending has risen significantly in recent years, keeping pace with and even exceeding overall
economic growth, the U.S. defense budget has, since 2001, grown even faster. Thus in 2000 the U.S. defense budget was
seven times that of China, and in 2010 it was ten times bigger. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down, the U.S. rate
of spending is likely to decrease, although probably not to Chinese levels. By 2025, RAND estimates that Chinese defense
spending will probably be somewhat more than half of America’s. Of course, all Chinese defense spending will be focused
on the Western Pacific, whereas only a fraction of America’s will be relevant to that region.<br><br>
These figures are much disputed in both the academic and intelligence communities. They rest on the somewhat shaky
foundation of current trends extrapolated far into the future. Using purchasing power parity rather than market exchange
rates, China catches up to and surpasses the United States much more quickly. Purchasing power parity is a better reflection<br><br>
of personnel costs, while market exchange rates better capture equipment costs, particularly high-tech equipment, which
tends to be the area of U.S.-Chinese competition of most concern to the United States.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
North Korea<br><br>
A North Korean collapse could emanate from a failed economy, a contested power transition
after the death of Kim Jong-il, or defeat in a war with the South. In any such scenario, the situation
in North Korea would likely be chaotic and confused. Hundreds of thousands, perhaps
millions, of civilians would migrate toward North Korea’s borders in search of food and safety
from clashes between rival armed groups. Collapse of central control would also jeopardize the
security of the North’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and missile assets China might
fully mobilize in the Shenyang Military Region (Shenyang MR), and could well send sizable
forces cross the Yalu in an effort to sort out refugee flows on the Korean side of their border.
The immediate operational concerns for United States ForcesCKorea/Combined Forces
Command (USFK/CFC) would be to secure ballistic missile launch and WMD sites. If any
coherent North Korean army remained, neutralizing Korean People’s Army (KPA) long-range
artillery threatening Seoul could also be needed. For these missions, special operations forces
(SOF), forced entry, and airlift capabilities will be at a premium. China meanwhile would view
the insertion of U.S. and Republic of Korea (ROK) forces north of the DMZ with concern,
and might move its own forces in, if it had not already begun to do so, both to contain the
disorder and preempt a ROK/U.S. takeover of the entire country.<br><br>
While the ROK would provide sizable forces and capabilities for these missions, they
would be inadequate to deal with the scope and complexity of a complete DPRK collapse.
Substantial and extended commitments of U.S. ground forces would be required to rapidly
seize and secure numerous locations, some with vast perimeters. SOF and dedicated chemical,
biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) units will be insufficient
to deal with the situation.<br><br>
The likelihood of confrontations, accidental or otherwise, between U.S. and Chinese
forces is high, with significant potential for escalation. Beyond the pressures to intervene and
deal with the immediate consequences of a failed DPRK, the United States will be forced to
confront the thorny issue of the desired end-state: unification (the preferred outcome of our
ally, the ROK) or the continued division of Korea (China’s strong preference).<br><br>
Taiwan<br><br>
While relations between China and Taiwan are improved and improving, no meaningful
progress has been made on the key issue between the two states, which is if, when, and how
the island’s ultimate status―as an independent polity or as part of a “reunified” China―will
be determined. The chance of conflict across the Taiwan Strait will remain so long as this fundamental
disagreement persists.<br><br>
A cross-Strait conflict could take many forms, from a Chinese blockade of Taiwanese
ports, to varied levels of bombardment of targets on Taiwan, to an outright invasion attempt.
Should the United States engage directly in any such contingency, its goals would be to prevent
Chinese coercion or conquest of Taiwan and limit to the extent possible the damage inflicted
on Taiwan’s military, economy, and society. Core missions for the United States would include
preventing China from gaining air and sea dominance, and limiting the impact of Beijing’s
land-attack missiles, all achieved through flexible combinations of active and passive defense
and offensive action, to include the possibility of U.S. strikes on mainland targets associated
with the offensive against Taiwan, with all the attendant risks of further escalation. Indeed,


China might well anticipate and seek to preempt such U.S. actions with attacks of its own on
U.S. assets in the region.<br><br>
As China’s military modernization progresses, the U.S. ability to confidently accomplish
these missions is eroding. In the near term, China is deploying capabilities that threaten U.S.
land and sea power projection platforms―air bases and aircraft carriers―as well as Taiwan’s
own defenses. Absent an unlikely reversal in the ongoing rebalancing of military power in
the area, and even recognizing the very considerable difficulties in mounting an amphibious
assault against determined local resistance, a direct defense of Taiwan has already become a
challenge and is likely to become increasingly difficult in coming years.<br><br>
Cyber-Space<br><br>
Sino-U.S. cyber-war could be an aspect of―or prelude to―armed hostilities. Or it could
begin and stay in cyber-space. This case is confined to that domain, though with some danger
of triggering armed conflict.<br><br>
Having conducted repeated intrusions into U.S. networks to exfiltrate sensitive data
without U.S. reprisal, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might seek and receive authority
to interfere with U.S. intelligence collection and dissemination on Chinese strategic-nuclear
programs. Chinese civilian leaders might not grasp that such operations would be defined
as cyber-attack by the United States and thus lead to retaliation. The attack could disrupt
systems the United States relies on for critical intelligence, including warning. If confident
that the PLA was the attacker, the United States might decide to retaliate. Given that corresponding
PLA intelligence networks are not easily accessed, and choosing to signal dangers of
escalation, the United States might retaliate against networks that support Chinese transport
systems, including commercial shipping as well as military logistics. The impact on Chinese
trade could be immediate. In addition, because the U.S. ability to observe Chinese forces had
been impaired, Pacific Command (PACOM) might be told to increase the readiness of its
forces. While China does not want armed conflict, it could respond by conducting “soft-kill”
attacks (e.g., link interference) on U.S. satellites that serve the Pacific command, control, communications,
computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) grid, to which
the United States responds in kind. Because both Chinese and U.S. network defenses are of
limited value against such large and sophisticated attacks, both sides might resort to counterattacks
in hopes of restoring deterrence.<br><br>
In the ensuing escalation, both China and the United States could suffer temporary but
major disruptions of critical networks, precipitating shocks in stock, currency, credit, and trade
markets. Although both sides avoid escalation to armed force, economic damage would be
considerable. Sino-U.S. cooperation on Iran would likely come to a halt, and the situation in
Korea could heat up. There are no lives lost―just extensive harm, heightened antagonism, and
loss of confidence in network security. There would be no “winner.”<br><br>
South China Sea<br><br>
There are numerous potential flash points in the South China Sea region. China’s assertion
of some degree of sovereignty over virtually the entire area rubs up against the rival claims of
numerous other states, and the areas around the Paracel and Spratly islands in particular have
witnessed limited clashes since the mid-1970s. A confrontation at sea could lead to a broader
conflict if, for example, an oceanic dispute between Vietnam and China escalated into a land
war between the two. The presence of a U.S. treaty ally, the Philippines, may elevate the stakes

for Washington if some deep crisis arises in or around the South China Sea. China’s recent
claims that the region is part of its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and therefore subject to
Chinese control, represent a test to global norms of free navigation and are a direct challenge
to U.S. interests in East Asia.<br><br>
Depending on the nature and severity of a conflict, U.S. objectives could range from
enforcing freedom of navigation against a Chinese effort to control maritime activities in the
South China Sea, to helping the Philippines defend itself from an air and maritime attack, to
supporting Vietnam and shielding Thailand―another treaty ally―in the event of a land war
in Southeast Asia.<br><br>
Any likely contingency in the South China Sea or Southeast Asia will make demands on
U.S. air and naval power to assure friendly dominance of the battlespace. A war on land could
create a demand for U.S. land forces―especially SOF and forced-entry capabilities.
China’s current ability to project substantial power into the South China Sea region is
limited; in particular, the PLA’s land-based combat aircraft lack adequate range to operate efficiently
so far from home. This assessment will change if China builds aircraft carrier and airrefueling
capabilities in the coming years. Direct defense in the South China Sea and Southeast
Asia should remain a viable strategy for the next twenty years.<br><br>
Japan
Sino-Japanese relations are contentious for at least two reasons. First, on the Chinese side,
anger, fear, and resentment over Japanese actions from the last years of the 19th century until
1945 remain alive and are not-infrequently exacerbated by what China sees as insensitive or
insulting Japanese behavior. Second, an ongoing territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu
islands and overlapping claims to exclusive economic zones in the East China Sea are persistent
irritants to the relationship. Conflict could arise from an at-sea incident in the East China Sea,
or from the escalation of a war of words amplified by some sort of maritime encounter.<br><br>
U.S. goals in the event of a Sino-Japanese dispute would be to help defend Japan and,
not incidentally, make the case that the United States remains the preferred security partner
in Asia despite China’s “rise.” Doing so would require helping limit damage to Japan and its
military and regaining control of the pertinent air and maritime domains. This might require
consideration of U.S. as well as Japanese strikes on mainland targets, with all the attendant
concerns for escalatory risk.<br><br>
Growth in China’s military capabilities, particularly its naval, air, and missile powerprojection
forces, will steadily increase the costs of dealing with a contingency of this kind.<br><br>
Absent a general U.S. withdrawal from the Western Pacific or a dramatic reduction in Japan’s
own self-defense capabilities, however, direct defense of Japan should remain a credible―if
increasingly challenging―strategy for the next twenty to thirty years.<br><br>
India
Conflict between China and India, which view each other as geostrategic rivals on the Asian
landmass, could be triggered by an incident along their long-contested common border or a
dispute over how to respond to a failing neighboring state such as Burma/Myanmar. Above
and beyond the dangers posed by a clash between the world’s two most populous countries, the
presence of nuclear weapons on both sides creates substantial escalatory risks.<br><br>
In either circumstance the United States would probably seek to stay out of the conflict,
with its chief immediate concern being the safety of tens of thousands of U.S. civilians in the

(NEOs) in one or more of the affected states. The political hurdles will be complicated and
the operational challenges daunting; significant air and naval components along with ground
forces would be required. The United States would likely extend overt diplomatic support for
India as well as quietly provide New Delhi with intelligence and military equipment. U.S.
strategic goals would be to prevent a Chinese victory and avoid vertical escalation (i.e., the use
of conventional or nuclear armed ballistic missiles) or horizontal escalation (e.g., involvement
of Pakistan).<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">Operational Implications</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
The above cases represent the range of plausible military contingencies involving China that
the United States could face in and beyond the next decade. They demonstrate that while
Sino-U.S. hostilities may be unlikely, the United States needs a wide range of advanced military
capabilities to deter or prevail, and in any case to preserve stability and exert influence in
regional affairs despite China’s growing power and reach. This need is shaped by an increasingly
capable PLA and by the diverse circumstances, geography, and domains―land, sea, air,
space, cyber―in which conflict could occur. In North Korea, U.S. ground, tactical air, strike,
and special operations forces could be needed; in Taiwan, a full array of naval and air forces; in
the South China Sea, U.S. blue-water superiority. In addition, these contingencies could place
heavy demands on U.S. C4ISR capabilities (largely space-based), given the distances, possible
intensity, and U.S. concepts of operations. Other than Korea, the contingencies do not call
for sizable U.S. ground forces. U.S. involvement in large-scale land warfare anywhere in East
Asia other than Korea is especially improbable. The Korean collapse scenario, judged the most
likely, could well involve some competition but probably not open conflict with China, but
would in either case call for a significant ground force contribution.<br><br>
Generally speaking, direct defense by U.S. forces as an operational option is feasible at
present, though confidence in this varies from the South China Sea (high) to North Korea
(medium) to Taiwan (medium-low). This is the result of the geographic orientation to date of
improvements in Chinese anti-access, area-denial, and limited power-projection capability―
e.g., short-range missiles―which is especially pronounced along China’s eastern coast and
toward Taiwan. For the next few years, China would find it difficult to exploit these advantages
in a Korean contingency, and the South China Sea lies outside the reach of Chinese sensors,
communications, and missiles, much less power projection. Over time, China will be able
both to increase its anti-access advantage where it currently exists and to expand it into the
Pacific, to Northeast Asia, and eventually to Southeast Asia. In addition, Chinese cyber and
anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities may in time be able to disrupt U.S. C4ISR and thus impair
direct defense. In sum, forward operating U.S. forces could become more vulnerable, precisely
the top priority of China’s military investments and deployments.<br><br>
The difficulties of direct defense could be greatly accelerated by Chinese development and
use of cyber-attack and ASAT weapons, given the dependence of U.S. forces and operating
concepts on computer-networked and space-based C4ISR. For this reason, the PLA appears to
think that hostilities in space and cyber-space would favor China, and so might initiate them.
At the same time, as China extends the reach of its own forces and C4ISR into the Pacific,

they will become vulnerable to U.S. cyber-attack and ASAT. In any case, any Sino-U.S. armed
conflict will be increasingly affected if not decided by warfare in these new domains.
The erosion of capabilities for direct defense will push the United States toward enhanced
weapons, ranges, geography, and targets both to regain survivability and to strike Chinese
forces, launchers, sensors, and other capabilities on the mainland (or elsewhere in the region
outside of the immediate theater). In addition, as the PLA develops cyber and ASAT capabilities
but also comes to rely more on advanced C4ISR, the United States will have to consider
striking Chinese satellites and computer networks. These trends will thus lead both sides to
widen their choice of targets in order to achieve dominance over any particular geographic
objective, however limited.<br><br>
The increasing difficulty in ensuring direct defense can be consequential even if Sino-U.S.
hostilities are unlikely, for they could stimulate Chinese risk-taking, increase U.S. inhibitions,
and weaken the resolve of U.S. allies and China’s neighbors in facing a China more insistent
on settling disputes on its terms. These trends are the result of underlying general technological
progress, sustainable growth in military spending, PLA reform and doctrinal adaptation,
and geographic distances for China and the United States. On the other hand, most of China’s
neighbors are growing economically and in technological sophistication, and some may choose
to keep pace in quality if not quantity with Chinese advances in the military field.<br><br>
Barring unforeseen technological developments that assure survivability for U.S. forces
and C4ISR, it will not be possible or affordable for the United States to buck these trends. As
the defense of Taiwan is already becoming problematic for U.S. forces (e.g., carriers and nearby
air bases), so will U.S. operational options in the event of a confrontation with China over
North Korea’s collapse and a crisis in Southeast Asia. Over time, the United States will feel the
need to rely increasingly on its more distant and less vulnerable capabilities. As U.S. forward
operating survivability declines, strike range must increase. U.S. military-operational emphasis
in the Western Pacific will thus shift from geographically limited direct defense to more
escalatory responses and eventually, when even these will not suffice, from deterrence based
on denial to deterrence based on the threat of punishment, with the speed of the shift varying
from, first of all, Taiwan, then Northeast Asia, then Southeast Asia at a somewhat later date.<br><br>
This will move the United States toward a choice between escalation―and deterrence
based on Chinese fear of escalation―and noninvolvement in hostilities near China that could
bring about direct armed conflict. Escalation can take several paths. Starting with the most
severe, the United States can make more explicit what has been only faintly implicit in its
strategy toward China: the threat to use nuclear weapons if conventional defense fails, if U.S.
forces face defeat, and/or if vital U.S. interests in the region could be harmed. Yet in none of
the above cases are U.S. vital interests at stake. Moreover, however low the credibility of a U.S.
nuclear threat may be today, it will be lower in the future because of China’s clear determination
and sufficient capacity to have a survivable second-strike deterrent force able to defeat U.S.
missile defense (e.g., through mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarinelaunched
ballistic missiles (SLBMs), multiple re-entry vehicles/multiple independent re-entry
vehicles (MRV/MIRVs), and penetration aids).<br><br>
Two more plausible and proportional escalation paths for the United States are to disable
Chinese satellites and computer networks, starting with those that enable Chinese forces to
operate. In both ASAT and cyber-war, it is easier to imagine how hostilities would start than
how they would end―very likely with attacks by both sides on critical civilian and economic
space systems and networks. The main reason for this is the dual-use nature of much of the


space and cyber infrastructure on which the U.S. military, and in due course the PLA, rely.
Compounding the problem is that both escalatory domains are offense-dominant, in that both
satellites and computer networks are exceedingly hard and costly to protect against very capable
attackers. Even with superior ASAT and cyber-war capabilities, the United States stands to
suffer as at least as much as China in space and cyber escalation, given its greater reliance on
these domains for military and intelligence missions and for its economic health.<br><br>
Perhaps the most promising military escalation path for the United States―most credible,
least dangerous, and most one-sided in its effects―is that of conventional precision strikes
against Chinese war-fighting and war-supporting targets on the mainland or wherever else
they might be. To the extent such strikes can be carried out from survivable platforms and/or
beyond the range of China’s medium-range missiles, the United States can recover both technological
(in targeting at any distance) and geographic advantages. It could also halt or reverse
the growing vulnerability of U.S. C4ISR to Chinese cyber and ASAT attacks. How long such
advantages, if recovered, could be extended beyond another decade or so depends on how long
it takes China to extend the reach of its surveillance, targeting, and strike capabilities. Given
China’s economic and technological potential, the answer might not be comforting for longterm
U.S. planning. In any case, U.S. conventional escalation, and thus deterrence based on
the threat of it, risks Chinese escalation, including cyber and ASAT―risks that may be mitigated
but not eliminated by careful choice of targets (avoiding strategic locations, civilians,
economic, and leadership targets), but will nonetheless grow over time. Conventional threats
to the command and control of Chinese nuclear forces could even prompt a Chinese nuclear
response.<br><br>
Priority Capabilities<br><br>
As Chinese anti-access and area-denial enhancements improve, the United States will become
more dependent on capabilities associated with the threat of escalation. Table 1 indicates the
capabilities that are currently important and those that may become more relevant in the
future.<br><br>
Economic Warfare<br><br>
Sanctions have typically been an option of choice for the United States when the risks, poor
cost-effectiveness, and opprobrium associated with military force are too great. But China is
far from typical, given the scale and intensity of Sino-U.S. economic interdependence. It is true
that for China the loss of export revenue, interest and liquidity of credit, investment returns,
and critical imports (oil, food, and commodities) would have a calamitous effect on its economic
and possibly domestic stability. However, the effects on U.S. equity and credit markets,
the value of the dollar, inflation, investment, consumption, and employment―while less as a
percent of GDP―would also be devastating, and lasting. Economic war against China would
more accurately be described as economic war with China, America’s principal creditor and
source of manufactured goods. Such war would likely lead to a global contraction much worse
than the one of 2008C2009.<br><br>
Thus, the question―a very fateful question―for the United States is whether it could
design economic measures that could hit China disproportionately hard, even while acknowledging
the impact on the U.S. and world economies. One such measure would be interference
with seaborne oil shipments to China (food presumably being off-limits even in war). However,
oil-transport routes and arrangements are such that the entire region, including Japan,
would suffer some level of disruption as a result of a distant U.S. blockade of Chinese trade.<br><br>
Of course, China would consider such an action to be a major escalation aimed at crippling its
economy and endangering domestic stability and the regime itself. China has been expanding
its strategic oil reserve and building oil and gas pipelines to Central Asia in order to mitigate
such dangers and would likely retaliate by other means.<br><br>

<a href= "pic05.html">Priority Capabilities</a><br><br>

Strategic Alternatives<br><br>
America’s capacity to ensure the defense of its friends and allies on China’s periphery will
diminish over the next several decades. This can be offset by a U.S. willingness to employ horizontal
and vertical escalation. China also has options in this regard, however. For the United
States, a strategy based upon escalation and ultimately on deterrence by punishment means
assuming greater risks in the future than in the past to achieve the same objectives. Some
American interests in the region may not justify such increased risks. This suggests the need
to supplement military deterrence with other forms of dissuasion, resistance, and persuasion.
Mutual Assured Economic Destruction (MAED)<br><br>
Short of a nuclear exchange, the greatest damage from any conflict with China is likely to
come in the economic realm. Massive and mutual economic harm would indeed result from
any significant Sino-U.S. armed conflict, even if the two sides eschewed employment of economic
weapons. The two economies are linked with each other and with the rest of the world
in a manner unparalleled in history. This mutual dependency can be an immensely powerful
deterrent, in effect a form of mutually assured economic destruction. At the moment the bal-
ance of advantage rests with the United States, but even the winner in such a contest will wish
it had been avoided.<br><br>
 
The operation of MAED is somewhat different from classic mutual assured destruction
(MAD). It is at least theoretically possible to limit the escalation of a military clash to the subnuclear
level. It is not possible to so limit the economic consequences. China is not going to
continue buying U.S. Treasury notes while the American and Chinese navies clash somewhere
off Taiwan or in the South China Sea. Apple is not going to be shipping iPads from its factories
in China. Markets will anticipate widespread disruption in U.S.-Chinese and world trade, and
advance the consequences, however much Beijing and Washington seek to limit the damage.
As is the case with MAD, even the weaker party gains deterrent benefit from the mutual,
if unevenly distributed, destruction. The point could be reached sometime in the next few
decades, however, when the balance of dependency had shifted so far against the United States
that it no longer represented an effective deterrent to Chinese advances against important if not
vital American interests in East Asia.<br><br>
This is not an argument for seeking to decouple the U.S. economy from the Chinese
economy, as that would simply be to dispense with the existent deterrent effect while it still has
great force. It is a reason to ensure that the balance of dependency does not shift too heavily
against the United States. It is often said that a strong economy is the basis of a strong defense.
In the case of China, a strong U.S. economy is not just the basis for a strong defense, it is itself
perhaps the best defense against an adventurous China.<br><br>
Reliance on Diplomacy<br><br>
If U.S. localized direct defense is endangered by Chinese anti-access capabilities in the near
term, and U.S. escalation is constrained by growing risks and growing Chinese military reach
in the mid to long term, the United States may be increasingly left without good militaryoperational
alternatives in regional contingencies involving Chinese forces. As several of these
cases suggest, this may weigh against U.S. involvement in contingencies where important U.S.
interests are not at stake. Unless China commits naked and large-scale aggression―which, to
be clear, is not indicated by its current pattern of use of force―this may involve greater reliance
on U.S. diplomacy and attempts to head off conflict by accommodating Chinese interests,
especially if they have merits. Of course, the declining efficacy of direct defense and increasing
riskiness of escalation (and thus of deterrence) would deplete U.S. influence over the outcome
of disputes, from maritime and territorial questions up to and including the fate of North
Korea and Taiwan.<br><br>
Building Partner Capacity<br><br>
Avoidance of direct military defense and escalation does not equate to U.S. passivity in particular
contingencies or in regional security generally. The United States has very capable allies
in the region in Japan, South Korea, and Australia, as well as other existing and prospective
partners that are already bristling at China’s growing power and assertiveness, as the developments
of the last year suggest. To date, there is no indication of diminishing resolve on
the part of China’s neighbors. Whether this pattern continues, strengthens, or is reversed by
increased Chinese capability to overcome U.S. direct defense and neutralize U.S. escalation
threats depends on how the United States encourages regional states to “stand up” to China,
politically and materially.<br><br>

two possible pitfalls. First it will want to avoid extending guarantees that it may not wish to
deliver on, and in so doing actually decrease incentives for great local defense efforts. Second,
were the United States to be seen trying to align East Asia against China―something it has so
far been careful not to do―it could stimulate an arms race with China which, at least locally,
it would be hard pressed to win.<br><br>
If instead the United States follows a dual strategy of engaging China, including in
regional security cooperation, while backing and enabling China’s East Asia neighbors, it
might be able to contribute to regional stability, sustain U.S. influence, and at least protect if
not advance U.S. interests in the region. Enabling allied and partner military capabilities, thus
increasing the costs of Chinese aggression, could have two basic components: (1) providing
critical capabilities (e.g., surveillance and targeting) that only the United States can provide
and (2) deterring China’s own escalatory options by the threat of counter-escalation, including
in space and counter-space, as well as nuclear deterrence in those rare instances where U.S.
vital interests are truly engaged.<br><br>
Shifting the U.S.-China Relationship<br><br>
A climate of mutual distrust and suspicion clouds the U.S.-China relationship, producing a
potent security dilemma. If ignored this dynamic could spiral out of control. Altering it will
require both the United States and China to fundamentally rethink their national security
goals and strategic assumptions in Asia and beyond. The U.S.-China competition should not
be viewed as a zero-sum game; indeed, the United States has a strong interest in changing these
perceptions. As China becomes a true peer competitor, it also becomes potentially a stronger
partner in the defense as well as economic field. At present, the United States, as the world’s
only superpower, bears a disproportionate burden for policing the global commons, protecting
international commerce and travel, and maintaining international security. China, like most
of the word, is a free rider on these efforts. Even as the United States seeks over the next several
decades to sustain its defense commitments and advance its interests in East Asia, it will
also have an interest in encouraging the world’s other emerging superpower to assume greater
responsibilities for international peace and security. China’s efforts to combat piracy in the
Indian Ocean and its growing interest in United Nations peacekeeping should, thus, become
the basis for enhanced U.S.-Chinese cooperation. In the long term, the United States will want
to look for other ways to leverage Chinese power as well as restrain it. This will be easier and
safer to do from a position of relative strength, which argues for starting this process of cooperation
sooner rather than later.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">Conclusion</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
With the passage of time and improvement of Chinese capabilities, the United States will find
itself forced to shift from deterrence by denial, based on direct defense of its interests and allies
in the Western Pacific, to deterrence by punishment, based on the threat of escalation, using
longer-range weapons and more survivable platforms. Although the United States can have
escalation dominance for some time, assuming it is prepared to conduct conventional strikes
on the Chinese mainland, China will develop escalation options of its own, including ASAT
and offensive cyber-warfare capabilities, thus increasing U.S. risks in escalation. Chinese strategic nuclear force improvement, and the limited stakes in the most plausible scenarios for
Sino-American conflict, will reduce the credibility of any U.S. threat to use nuclear weapons.
One means of improving the prospects for direct defense and reducing the risk of escalation
is for the United States to enable the capabilities and buttress the resolve of China’s neighbors.<br><br>
Such a strategy should be designed to raise the costs of Chinese use of force and to check
Chinese assertiveness at the expense of regional stability and U.S. interests. Such a strategy
should not be―or be seen as―a U.S. attempt to encircle or align the region against China,
lest it produce greater Chinese hostility. Indeed, a parallel effort should be made to draw China
into cooperative security endeavors, not only to avoid the appearance of an anti-China coalition
but also to obtain greater contributions to international security from the world’s secondstrongest
power. The United States should also continue to explore cooperative solutions to
some of the above-cited sources of conflict. For instance, the collapse of North Korea could
become an opportunity for U.S.-Chinese collaboration.<br><br>
The economic consequences of a Sino-American conflict could be historically unparalleled,
even if both sides avoid economic warfare. This is a powerful mutual deterrent, one marginally
in the U.S. favor at present. Strengthening the U.S. economy is the best way of ensuring
that the balance of interdependence and of the associated deterrence does not shift dangerously
against the United States over the next several decades.<br><br>
While the risk of conflict with China cannot be ignored, neither should it be exaggerated.
Any number of other conflicts are more likely, some in places we cannot even vaguely
foresee at present, just as no one foresaw our engagement in the Balkans in 1989, our invasions
of Afghanistan and Iraq on September 10, 2001, or our current commitment in Libya as
recently as six months ago. These more likely conflicts will be with opponents quite different
from China and will call for capabilities quite dissimilar from those required to deal with a
real peer competitor. Individually, these contingencies will be less consequential than a conflict
with China, but collectively they will shape the international environment in which both
countries interact and will fundamentally influence Chinese perceptions of American power
and determination. Coping successfully with these smaller challenges may be one of the best
ways to ensure that we never have to fight the larger conflict.<br><br>

中国的金融市场不断深化，外资持续注入投资，资金也在向外流出。要胜任全球金融强国的新角色，中国需要具备什么条件 <br><br>
Richard Dobbs, Nick Leung, and Susan Lund<br><br>
http://www.mckinseychina.com<br><br>

中国是全世界最大的储蓄国，在新兴市场对全球金融版图的影响与日俱增之际，中国的地位更显举足轻重。今天，占全球GDP38%的新兴国家，只占到全球海外投权投资（global foreign investment in equities）的7%，海外债券投资（global foreign lending）只占13% 1。金融危机过后，发达经济体增长缓慢，人口结构问题严峻化，新兴国家似乎准备好在重构中的金融版图顺势成长。在此重构过程中，中国领头先行，有望成为真正的全球金融重镇，将人民币塑造成为国际主流货币。 然而，这个封闭多年的经济体――尽管坐拥超过3万亿美元的外汇储备――无法做到在一夜之间敞开门户。倘若中国要更有效吸引资金、配置资金，中国国内金融市场必须进一步深化改革，提高政府、企业和家庭的投资回报。与此同时，必须逐步降低个人和企业投资海外以及外国人投资中国的限制，并致力于赢得全球投资人的信任。只要中国持续推动改革，结合其庞大的国内储蓄和举足轻重的全球贸易地位，不出数年，中国势必能跃身成为最具影响力的全球资金来源提供国。 增长与增长的挑战 中国的国内金融资产总值（包含股票、债券和贷款）已达17.4万亿美元，仅次于美国和日本（见图1）。在短短二十年间增长超过了十倍，这还不包括香港的资金“桥梁”作用。 <br><br> 

<a href= "pic07.html">中国金融资产统计</a><br><br>

发达经济体的银行贷款在去杠杆化的普遍作法下停滞不前，中国的银行贷款自2007年增长了5.8万亿美元，达国内生产总值的132%――高于发达经济体123%的平均比例。中国约有85%的贷款是贷给企业，其余则是贷给家庭。监管机构尝试为过热的房地产等市场降温，但贷款的快速增长仍然加深了授信泡沫和未来不良贷款窜升的担忧。 中国的公司债市场也在增长当中。过去5年，非金融企业的债券余额每年增长45%，金融机构的债券则增长23%2 。由于中国债券市场的借款程度远低于发达经济体，因此进一步增长的空间很大。事实上，中国蓬勃发展的各产业可以把债券融资作为替代资金来源，让银行能够增加对家庭和中小型企业的贷款。 然而，自全球金融危机和经济衰退后，中国股票市场欲振乏力。一些主要股票市场都已出现反弹，但中国的总体市值却自2007年以来下跌了50%，从2007年7.2万亿美元重挫至2012年第二季的3.6万亿美元。显示出中国股市与其他新兴经济体一样震荡激烈。 跨境投资潮 全球跨境资金流于2008年崩盘，之后比金融危机前的高点低了60%（见图2），但中国却得以幸免。中国的外商直接投资（FDI）、跨境存贷款、外商股债组合投资比2007年高了44%，2011年底，外商在中国的总投资达4770亿美元，高过2007年3310亿美元的高峰 3。外商企业大约占了流入中国资金的2/3。  <br><br>

<a href= "pic08.html">跨境资金流动</a><br><br>

随著中国持续对外商组合投资限制松绑，来自国外投资机构和个人的资金可成为增长的又一支柱。中国监管机构批准的合格境外机构投资者（QFII）从2005年的33家增加到2012年207家，且必将持续增加。同时，监管机构也给予注册外资更大空间，把境外持有的人民币投资到中国国内资本市场。这两项举措进一步打开了外资参与这些市场的大门。 众所周知，中国的中央银行――中国人民银行――累积了全世界存量最大的外汇储备：截至2012年底其外汇储备高达3.3万亿美元。这笔庞大资金大多投资在低风险的主权债上（例如至少占中国外汇储备1.2万亿美元的美国国债），不过这类投资的增长率已大幅减缓。相反地，中国目前一边放松其他外流资金类型的限制，一边逐步将海外持有资产多元化经营，这正是2007年设立中国投资有限责任公司（CIC）的初衷。中投公司是全世界最大的主权财富基金之一，资产规模4820亿美元，持有资产包括许多全球蓝筹股公司的股份，矿业、能源、基础设施项目，全球房地产，甚至持有伦敦希思罗机场的股份。 中国企业在全球金融的地位也提高了。国有和私有企业的海外投资，从2000年的区区10亿美元，飙升至2011年的1010亿美元。截至2011年底，全球外商直接投资中，有3640亿美元来自中国企业，大多与商品有关。这些投资将近一半投入其他新兴市场，此比例高于发达经济体的企业。 中国在全球债权迅速增长，大多数与中国企业的海外投资挂钩，例如提供秘鲁矿业融资，而相关的建筑工程则由某家中国企业承担。2011年底，中国国外存贷款余额总计8380亿美元，想想全球五大多边开发银行的贷款余额加起来才不过5000亿美元左右，中国势力可见一斑。自2009年起，中国对拉丁美洲的贷款额已超过美洲开发银行与世界银行（见图3）。<br><br>
<a href= "pic09.html">中国对拉丁美洲的贷款统计</a><br><br>

非洲是另一个重心。在2012年中非合作论坛上，中国承诺未来三年将新增200亿美元贷款给非洲。2013年3月，中国国家主席习近平首次以国家领导人身份出访非洲，重申此贷款承诺，并签署协议，在坦桑尼亚兴建价值数十亿美元的港口与工业区。 目前为止，中国许多国内投资的回报率一直低于资金成本。不论是企业投入资本、国内银行存款、还是政府从外汇储备的收益，低回报几乎是在意料之内；在某些情况下，甚至出现负值的实质回报率。中国近期外商直接投资和国外贷款的回报如何仍有待观察。回报率如何调整至贴近市场水平，其速度和过程将对政策制定者形成挑战。 人民币自由兑换尚需时日 随著中国经济和金融势力不断增强，人民币的通用性势必将增加。中国的目标是将人民币打造成为国际货币，最终能与美元和欧元相抗衡。但要实现这个目标，必须在几个方面取得长足进步4 。其中之一是为人民币金融资产发展出兼具深度和流动性的国内资本市场。另外，中国的金融深度（亦即金融资产总值占国内生产总值的比例）一直不及发达经济体的一半，发展较大型的债券市场，以及规避货币与其他风险的衍生品市场将极为重要。 人民币要发挥更大的国际作用，也必须具备国际可兑换性。近年来，中国提倡以人民币结算国际贸易合同，例如签署互换协议，供应15家国外中央银行人民币，包括澳大利亚和新加坡的中央银行。结果，中国贸易中人民币的使用从几年前只有3%，增加至2012年预估有10%。根据汇丰银行的调查，到2015年估计将有1/3的中国企业在国际贸易中以人民币结算 5。 然而，要成为真正的国际货币，人民币必须实现完全自由兑换，也就是任何人或公司不论任何理由都能在任一家银行或外汇经销商把人民币兑换成外币。中国中央银行表示朝此方向发展并加速开放资本帐的时机已经来到 6，最近宣布了此进程的短期和长期蓝图。短期举措可包括减少对贸易相关直接投资的管控，鼓励中国企业进一步增加对外直接投资；长期方面，人民银行已提出若干行动，例如开放信用渠道以利同时流入、流出中国，管理货币政策则从原本从量改为从价。长期来看，中国必须建立一套规则，持续落实并遵守，方能建立机构的信任。 不过目前大门只开了部分，要全面开放资本帐户，消除货币管控，所需要的制度将有赖时间。 * * * 随着全球长期投资需求持续攀升，高储蓄率意味着中国及其资金在全球市场的重要性与日俱增。要担当全球金融强国的责任，中国必须拥抱金融全球化，更全面地推进改革，虽然这不是一蹴而就，但中国正在逐步开放。中国新旧领导更替递嬗，这是一个关键时刻：新的经济团队若能够把握住改革步调，全世界的金融体系将在短短十年后就会呈现截然不同的面貌。 <br><br>

Testimony presented to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission on May 19, 2005<br><br>

Published 2005 by the RAND Corporation<br><br>

Statement of William H. Overholt1<br><br>
Asia Policy Chair<br><br>
Director, Center for Asia Pacific Policy<br><br>
The RAND Corporation<br><br>
Before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission<br><br>
May 19, 2005<br><br>
Summary<br><br>
China has transformed itself from the world’s greatest opponent of globalization, and
greatest disrupter of the global institutions we created, into a committed member of those
institutions and advocate of globalization. It is now a far more open economy than Japan
and it is globalizing its institutions to a degree not seen in a big country since Meiji
Japan. Adoption of the rule of law, of commitment to competition, of widespread use of
English, of foreign education, and of many foreign laws and institutions are not just
updating Chinese institutions but transforming Chinese civilization.
All of China’s economic successes are associated with liberalization and globalization,
and each aspect of globalization has brought China further successes. Never in world
history have so many workers improved their standards of living so rapidly. Thus
popular support for globalization is greater than in Japan, where postwar recovery
occurred in a highly managed economy, or with the former Soviet Union, where shock
therapy traumatized society. In consequence, China has effectively become an ally of
U.S. and Southeast Asian promotion of freer trade and investment than is acceptable to
Japan, India and Brazil.<br><br>


Nonetheless, rapid Chinese globalization has required stressful adjustments. State
enterprise employment has declined by 44 million. China has lost 25 million
manufacturing jobs. 125 car companies are expected to consolidate rapidly into 3 to 6.
China’s globalization successes are profoundly influencing its neighbors. India has
learned from China the advantages of a more open economy. Asians schooled in
antipathy to foreign investment and Latin Americans with protectionist traditions are
going to have to be more open to foreign investment and less dependent on loans in order
to compete with China. This will transform third world strategies of development and
create broader global opportunities for our companies.<br><br>
Contrary to early fears, China’s rise has stimulated neighbors’ trade and foreign
investment rather than depriving them. Indeed China’s recent growth spurt revived
Japan’s economy and saved key neighbors from recession, possibly averting a dangerous
global downturn.<br><br>
Chinese growth has brought American companies new markets. The flow of profits from
China to the U.S. is as disproportionate as the flow of goods. Inexpensive products have
substantially improved the living standards of poorer Americans. Inexpensive Chinese
goods and Chinese financing of our deficit have kept U.S. inflation and interest rates
down and prolonged our economic booms. At the same time, it has caused trade deficits
and social adjustments. Chinese misappropriation of intellectual property creates losses
for many of our companies. A manic construction and transportation boom has raised
global raw materials prices, to the great benefit of producers and a great cost to
consumers.<br><br>
China’s success is one of the most important developments of modern history, but
projecting from current growth to Chinese global dominance or threats to our way of life
is just wrong. Unlike the old Soviet Union, reformist China does not seek to alter any
other country’s way of life. Its economy faces world history’s most severe combination
of banking, urbanization and employment challenges, and by 2020 a demographic
squeeze that will have few workers supporting many dependents. The best outcome for
us would be a China that is eventually like Japan, prosperous, winning in some sectors,
losing in others. Signs that China is making rapid progress in that direction should be
welcomed, not feared.<br><br>


China and Globalization<br><br>
Before reform, China was the world’s most important opponent of globalization. It had
an autarkic economy. It opposed the global economic order. It opposed the global
political order and the major global institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank. It
believed that global disorder was a good thing, and under Mao Zedong it actively
promoted disorder throughout the world, including promotion of insurgencies in most of
China’s neighbors, in much of Africa and Latin America, and even in our universities.
Accompanying foreign policy disaffection was domestic cultural despair on a scale the
world has seldom witnessed. In the Cultural Revolution, 1966-1976, China’s students
and others, under the guidance of Mao Zedong’s peasant chiliasm, humiliated a majority
of senior government and party leaders, attacked the country’s major educational, social
and political institutions, destroyed much of China’s cultural heritage, and in general
tried to smash the country’s establishment.<br><br>
For two centuries Chinese had tried a range of ways C socialism, capitalism, empire,
republic, warlords, religious fundamentalism, and others. All failed. Alienation was so
severe that, along with students, much of the country accepted that the world economic
and political order, and the Chinese economic and political order, were so stacked against
them that any path to success had to start with destruction of the existing order.<br><br>
The Cultural Revolution was actually just one small episode in the problems that Chinese
impoverishment and political division created for the world and specifically for us. Had
China been prosperous and unified throughout the twentieth century, we would have had
European War II rather than World War II and World War I would have been quite
different. China would have been able to deter or defeat Japanese aggression. The cost
of those conflicts to the U.S. would have been radically smaller because Pearl Harbor and
much else would not have happened. We and the world, not to speak of a billion Chinese
citizens, have paid a horrible price, over more than a century, for China’s weakness. The
world needs a healthy China.<br><br>
Because of China’s successful globalization we no longer have such problems. China is
no longer a vacuum that sucks the world’s great powers into gigantic conflicts. China no

longer sponsors insurgencies in Southeast Asia and Africa and Latin America. China no
longer seeks to undermine the global financial institutions. We obtain benefits from a
China that supports stable capitalist democracy in Thailand and the Philippines; that joins
the IMF, World Bank, and WTO; and that counsels its neighbors about the benefits of
political stability, free trade, and free investment.<br><br>
From the beginning of the Cold War, it has been the central tenet of U.S. foreign policy
that, if we could engage as much of the world as possible in successful economic growth,
through domestic reform and what came later to be called globalization, we could
stabilize Europe and Asia, win the Cold War, and create a stable global order. Our
military protected this process, but from the Marshall Plan to our aid missions in Asia
and Africa, the core long-run strategy of our country has been to engage the world and
stabilize it by enmeshing other countries in a web of institutions and successful economic
practices that constitute the kind of world we want.<br><br>
This strategy has proved to be one of the most successful geopolitical strategies in human
history, so much so that it has entangled our former enemies as well as our allies in the
web we wove. Throughout, it has stimulated many controversies, and occasional waves
of fear in this country. Key industries, including especially textiles and shoes, have
successively opposed liberal trade with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Southeast Asia,
China and Latin America. We had a wave of panic over whether Japan was going to take
over all manufacturing and buy all our most important assets; after all, if they could
triumph in steel, cars, and televisions, and buy Rockefeller Center, wasn’t everything in
our economy at risk? Elsewhere, weren’t we sponsoring horrible dictatorships by
encouraging the development of Taiwan and South Korea? Each time, our fears have
proved excessive, and each time our strategy triumphed. The results have been good for
our security, good for our prosperity, good for political liberalization overseas, and good
for the people of our trading partners. Our concerns about China are the same.<br><br>

What we never expected from our strategy was that it would entice our former
adversaries, including China, into our web of economic institutions and our commitment
to geopolitical stability.<br><br>

Although joining late, China has joined the globalized system much more enthusiastically
than Japan. China’s economy is much more open than Japan. China’s trade in 2004 was
equal to 70% of its GDP, Japan’s to 24%. China received $60.6 billion of foreign direct
investment in 2004, while Japan, with an economy several times larger and in a phase of
restructuring that should have attracted disproportionate foreign investment, received
only $20.1 billion.<br><br>
China’s globalization is not confined to opening the economy but more importantly to
globalization of institutions. Here the development strategy of contemporary China bears
a striking resemblance to that of early Meiji (mid-nineteenth century) Japan, when the
Japanese government was sending missions around the world to choose for emulation the
best foreign navy (Britain), the best foreign education system (Germany), and so forth.
In the intervening century and a half, Japanese practice has become more inward-looking,
while China has evolved from Qing defensiveness and Maoist peasant xenophobia to an
assimilative cosmopolitanism.<br><br>
Today China is the country that sends missions throughout the world seeking best
practice. It adapts not just foreign technology and foreign corporate management
techniques but also a wide variety of foreign institutions and practices: international
accounting standards; British, U.S. and Hong Kong securities laws; French military
acquisition systems; a central bank structure modeled on the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank;
Taiwan-style regulations for foreign portfolio investment; an economic development
strategy adapted from South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan; and many others. Among the
most important of these changes are the decision to adopt the Western concept of rule of
law; adoption of competition as a centrally important economic practice; and adoption of
English language as virtually a second language for the educated Chinese population.<br><br>
Today I can lecture in Peking University and interview senior officials in Beijing and
Shanghai without a translator. Perhaps most importantly, China has sent its elite youth
abroad for education in an exercise of internationalism comparable to the Romans turning
over their children to the Greeks.<br><br>
Of course, such changes occur gradually; you can’t instantly introduce Western
accounting or Western law in a country that starts with no professional accountants or
lawyers. But the changes are startlingly fast compared with what other countries do.
More importantly, these are not technical adaptations in the manner of the old dynastic efforts to pursue “Western technology, Chinese culture.” These are transformative
processes that in cases like rule of law and promotion of competition repudiate core
aspects of traditional Chinese civilization that go back for millennia.<br><br>
China is also experiencing globalization of tastes. The exposure of the Chinese
population to foreign brands has been incorporating them into global culture. To take
one example, I spent many months studying the Chinese car industry. One of the
questions we were asked was whether China might develop indigenous car models in a
closed-off market like that of South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. What we discovered
was that the Chinese people have been so much more exposed to global culture than
South Koreans of a generation ago that no car could succeed in China unless it
incorporated global designs and prestigious foreign technologies. Ten to thirty years ago,
when South Korea was at a phase of car industry development more comparable to China
today, one virtually never saw a European or American car on the road, and they are still
very rare today. But in China the roads are packed with Volkswagens and Buicks.<br><br>
China has come to believe in globalization more than most third world countries and
many first world countries. China’s successes have all coincided with “reform and
opening,” that is, with globalization. In contrast, Japan’s and South Korea’s successes
occurred in an era when, although they were globalizing, they employed far stricter
controls on trade, foreign investment, and domestic economic activity than today’s
China.<br><br>
Globalization has required extremely painful adjustments by China. Employment in the
state enterprises has declined from 110 million at the end of 1995 to 66 million in March
2005. Those who think there has been a simple transfer of U.S. manufacturing jobs to
China will be surprised to know that manufacturing jobs in China have declined from
over 54 million in 1994 to under 30 million today. Even these striking numbers
understate the adjustments China has had to accept due to greater competition and lately
from WTO membership. For instance, while employment in the car industry has
remained relatively constant, the number of car manufacturers is expected to decline from
125 at the peak to somewhere between three and six. Meanwhile, foreign joint ventures
have come to dominate much of the market.<br><br>

It is hard to overstate the social adjustment Chinese are experiencing. But because China
has been willing to accept such adjustments, no large country in human history has ever
experienced such rapid improvements in living standards and working conditions. When
reform began, workers in Shanghai all wore the same clothes, looked tired and listless,
and seldom owned basic appliances like televisions or even watches. In the countryside
malnutrition was widespread. Today Shanghai workers wear colorful clothes and look
confident and energetic. Today the average Chinese family owns slightly more than one
television. Malnutrition has vanished. As a result, Chinese overwhelmingly support
further globalization.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">China’s globalization and other countries</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
China’s globalization has of course strongly influenced other countries too. The most
important impact has been on India’s economic policy and performance. Since
independence India’s economy had been hobbled by extremely protectionist trade
policies, an antagonistic stance toward foreign direct investment, and a remarkable
network of domestic socialist economic controls called the license raj, combined with
strong foreign economic and political ties to the old Soviet Union. A 1991 foreign
exchange squeeze and neighboring China’s success shocked India and also showed that
abandoning the old hostility to globalization could lead to prosperity. While India started
later than China and moved more slowly, India’s economic growth rates have doubled.
The number of people in absolute poverty has declined sharply. Exports have boomed
and foreign exchange reserves are ample for the first time in modern history. Visit India
today, as I did last month, and you find the kind of hope and confidence and energy that
once seemed confined to East Asia.<br><br>
As happened earlier with China, India’s newfound economic dynamism has shifted the
balance of leaders’ priorities from conflictful geopolitical goals to mutual economic
interests. India’s relations with its neighbors, sometimes including even Pakistan, and
most notably with both China and ourselves, are much better than previously. Indeed,
Indian-Chinese relations are better than at any time since the conflicts of the 1960s, and
India’s business community has shifted from terror about competition with China to
confidence in India’s competitive advantages and even some celebration of India’s recent
trade surplus with China.<br><br>


China’s influence on India’s economic policies is just one example of a much wider
phenomenon that is probably just beginning. Until recently, most of the third world plus
Japan has taken a relatively hostile attitude toward foreign direct investment. Difficult
licensing requirements, high taxes, unfair judicial treatment and an negative opinion
climate have faced direct investors from Japan and South Korea to the Philippines and
Thailand to India, not to mention most of Latin America. Instead of accepting foreign
ownership, countries typically relied on foreign loans (South Korea, Southeast Asia,
Latin America) or domestic loans (Japan), frequently creating an excessive burden of
debt. Thailand imposed very high taxes and then reduced them for selected foreign
investors; Indian groups attacked Kentucky Fried Chicken with distorted hygiene
allegations. Now such tactics are waning.<br><br>
The success of China at balancing debt with equity, building upon the previous successes
of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, is gradually changing the way much of the world
manages economic development. This Chinese influence is going to be transformative,
particularly in Asia. The old pattern has been to avoid dependence on foreign investment
by taking domestic and foreign bank loans. Governments then controlled the
development of industry by channeling the bank loans. This made companies and
countries overly dependent on banks, leading to periodic financial crises. It gave
governments too much control over industries, encouraging mismanagement and
corruption. It gave unfair advantages to large, politically favored companies over smaller
companies and foreign companies. Importantly for us, it limited the opportunities for our
own companies. Now competition with China will force most companies to open
themselves to foreign investment. American companies will benefit not just in China but
throughout the world.<br><br>
At the beginning of this decade, there were widespread fears that China’s success would
suck the trade and investment away from its Asian neighbors, impoverishing them. In
the event, the opposite has happened. Wherever rules have been changed to welcome
foreign direct investment, as in India, South Korea, and Japan, such investment has
boomed. China has taught others to attract foreign investment, and in response the total
pool of foreign investment has greatly expanded.<br><br>
Amid the global slowdown following the tech bust, countries like South Korea and the
Philippines found themselves saved from recession by Chinese demand. Most importantly, Chinese demand provided the stimulus that lifted Japan out of recession. It
is difficult to overstate the risk the world economy faced from the Japanese situation,
where mountainous debt created the risk of a domino-like collapse inside Japan and
subsequent rippling collapses around the world. That risk seems to have passed, helped
by a critical margin of stimulus from China. Few books are written about global
depressions that never happened, but it is quite possible that China’s globalization saved
us from beginning the new century with a drastic global economic squeeze.<br><br>
Many other peoples have benefited from Chinese demand that rose just as the world
economy was slowing. Raw materials producers had become inured to terms of trade that
deteriorated inexorably year after year. Suddenly our ally Australia found that its terms
of trade have improved to the best in its entire history, largely because of Chinese
demand. Many of the world’s poorest countries, including Laos, Papua New Guinea, and
much of Africa, benefited just when they needed it most. No aid programs, no IMF gold
sales could have come close to providing the improved livelihoods that resulted from
increasing, sustained demand for their products.<br><br>
In short, the most important results of China’s rise are the same as the results for the
world of America’s rise or of the recoveries of Japan and Europe: you are always better
off with a rich neighbor than with a denizen of the slums.<br><br>
Benefits and costs for the U.S.<br><br>
China’s globalization has had numerous impacts on the U.S. Most obviously, China has
become a vast market for U.S. goods. Arguments that this is a mythic “China Dream”
have proved false. Coca Cola has long since surpassed the fabled goal of selling a billion
Cokes. General Motors, once ridiculed by the China Dream theory, sells many Buicks in
China, and, despite a current cyclical pause, profits from China have been a critical
margin for GM during a difficult time. We gain from billions of dollars of profits
remitted back to our country and from the improved health of our most successful
companies as they compete against other foreign companies.<br><br>
Lower prices for basic goods have contributed significantly to American standards of
living, particularly for our less prosperous citizens. While we do not yet have definitive
studies, indications are that lower-income Americans achieve improvements in their standards of living of perhaps 5% to 10% as a result of being able to buy lower-priced
imports from China. That impact is undoubtedly expanded by the fact that competition
from China drives other countries to produce less expensive goods for our consumption.
Inexpensive Chinese goods have kept down our inflation rates and enabled us to prolong
the upswings of our business cycles because the Fed doesn’t have to raise interest rates so
quickly in order to slow inflation. Similarly, Chinese purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds
have helped to finance our budget deficits. Without those Chinese purchases we would
either have to raise interest rates, slowing our growth, or we would have to run
comparable trade deficits with other countries so that they could buy our bonds.<br><br>
We are just beginning to see another layer of benefits. The Chinese are beginning to
invest here. Haier is now manufacturing refrigerators in this country. When China’s
Lenovo bought IBM’s personal computer business, it saved jobs in a moribund division,
freed IBM to move up into higher-tech markets, and helped finance that IBM move up.
So far, this trend is small, but it will grow quickly. China’s goal for this year is to spend
$30-40 billion buying resource and distribution companies.<br><br>
We also benefit indirectly from China’s boost to foreign economies like Japan and
Australia. Having a prosperous partner is invaluable to the U.S. economy. We spent the
1980s fretting about Japan taking over the world, but we spent the 1990s worrying that
Japan wasn’t doing its share to boost global growth. Those who worry about China’s
success would have far more to worry about if China’s growth slowed drastically.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">Adjustment problems</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
China’s globalization and growth also cause stresses for us. Some of these are politically
eternal but economically and strategically tired. As countries get rich, the manufacture of
textiles, and shoes, furniture and basic consumer electronics mostly migrates elsewhere.
The manufacture of socks migrated from here to Japan, from Japan to South Korea and
Taiwan, and thence to Southeast Asia and now China. That adjustment will continue. It
has been gradual over many decades. We have had ten years to get ready for the current
round of textile adjustments. We knew what was coming and we agreed to it, in return
for China so stressful that they are virtually beyond Americans’ imagination. Our own
adjustments are smaller than those of virtually any other country.<br><br>


These adjustments are smaller than we tend to believe, because China gets blamed for
much that it does not cause. Virtually all of our job loss has been caused by productivity
improvements. In fact, productivity gains have been sufficiently large that we should
have experienced more job losses than we have. It is conceivable that our job losses have
been smaller than they “should” have been because China has helped us adapt. We don’t
know, because no lobby has been interested in paying for the research to find out how
many jobs have been saved by partial moves to China decreasing the costs of endangered
companies. And China is, of course, just part of a global readjustment caused by China,
India, and the former Soviet Union joining our economic system.<br><br>
A more serious policy problem is hyper-competition created by cheap financing in China.
The irrationalities of the Chinese financial system mean that in key sectors like steel
China builds too many factories, and props up too many moribund companies, causing
massive overcapacity. In recent years Chinese financial vagaries have led to excessive
construction and huge demand for steel, aluminum, cement and others. For a while this
has buoyed the global steel industry, including ours. But it has also led to construction of
so many steel factories in China that soon China will have half of all world capacity.
That means overproduction and eventually a steel price bust.<br><br>
This cycle creates problems for our industry, just as our Internet mania and tech bubble
created problems for much of the world. It is fair for us to complain about such
problems. It is fair to pressure the Chinese to reform their financial practices. It may be
fair in some cases to view Chinese bank lending practices as constituting an inappropriate
subsidy. The tone of our complaints and the substance of our policies needs, however, to
reflect three facts. First, the Chinese are trying to reform their banks and put them on a
market basis. Second, our financial vagaries cause them problems too. Third, the biggest
price for their financial mismanagement will eventually be paid by them, because
inappropriate lending eventually makes troubled banks much more troubled. China
making steel today looks like Japan buying Rockefeller Center two decades ago; if you
project their excesses indefinitely into the future, first the Japanese and now the Chinese
look as if they are about to take over everything in the world. But when you look at their
underlying finances, you see a black hole. The Japanese spent the 1990s in their black
hole and are still trying to climb out. China will feel the pain of its recent spree for many
years. Having said these things, some excesses may require a policy response by us.<br><br>


Chinese theft of intellectual property has become a major issue. The IPR problems
presented by China are similar to those presented by other developing countries. In the
1930s, Japan built cars that were half Ford parts and half GM parts, with DeSoto styling.<br><br>
In the early days of Japan’s postwar takeoff, a high proportion of its electronics exports
infringed Texas Instruments’ patents. I, like numerous others, accumulated a library of
knockoff books from Taiwan in the 1970s, and Taiwan still has the best knockoff
watches. When I lived in Singapore in 1998, I could get knockoffs of most Hollywood
movies at a six-story building within five minutes’ walk of my office, and indeed well
into the 1990s official U.S. government briefings credited Singapore for some 70% of the
knockoff computer software in Asia C at a time when China was getting most of the
blame. China’s IPR practices today are not very different from those of India and
Russia. But the scale and efficiency of China, and the extent of foreign direct investment
in China, make the issue a larger one. Indeed, the IPR losses caused by Chinese practices
are probably on a scale with those of other major emerging markets, like for instance
American youth. It is appropriate for us to make very strong representations about IPR
abuses. It is appropriate for us to implement policies that punish bad behavior and
reward better behavior. It is also useful to maintain a certain historical perspective.<br><br>
The other side of the benefits Australia, Africa, Latin America, and other resource
providers (including part of our own economy) have received from Chinese demand is a
rise in prices for consumers, and we are more consumer than producer of raw materials.<br><br>
For many key materials, the biggest part of recent price rises has been cyclical. The
Chinese mania for steel, aluminum and cement has peaked. In the case of petroleum, the
cumulative increase in demand caused by China, India, Russia, and other developing
countries may soon push against long-run supply constraints. This may compel us to
make new, potentially urgent decisions about conservation, the kind of energy we use
and the degree to which we compete or collaborate with the other major users. This
would have happened eventually even without the rise of China, but China is certainly
accelerating the issue.<br><br>
Finally, the rise of China raises questions about whether we face a major challenge to our
role in the world or to our way of life. One part of this is easy. We do not face a
challenge to our way of life. Unlike the Soviet Union, and unlike China under Mao Zedong, reformist China does not seek to change the way we organize ourselves or the
world, but rather to join the world system we have created.<br><br>
Geopolitical competition raises more complicated issues. Like South Korea, as China
grows it gets stronger. Its military becomes more modern. In one particular area, the
Taiwan Straits, maintaining our dominance will become increasingly difficult. That is a
serious and difficult and legitimate challenge for our military to cope with. But theories
that China is going to take over the world suffer from the same flaws as theories two
decades ago that Japan was going to take over the world. The Chinese military has to
defend 11,000 miles of not-always-friendly borders, and its growing military is far from
excessive for the tasks it faces. Economically, China is not going to manufacture
everything in the world; no country can have a comparative advantage in everything.<br><br>
In the medium term China faces daunting challenges. Its banks are the worst in the world
that we know about. In each generation a population about the size of the United States
will move from China’s countryside to its cities. Each year 12-13 million new workers
join the work force. The impact of productivity on employment in manufacturing is
much more severe than in our country. All these people need jobs. For a considerable
period China’s high growth can be sustained, but only through heroic reform measures by
China’s leaders. If somehow China powers through these problems, by 2020 its aging
population will have the worst ratio of workers to non-workers of any population in the
world, including Japan’s. That is to say, without some miraculous new policies the
Chinese economy may well hit a wall in that period. In 2020, they will still be a very
poor country by our standards. Even if their success continues until then, they will not be
taking over the world.<br><br>
The emergence of China as a principal advocate of globalization and stability creates a
complex geopolitical situation for us. On issues of free trade and investment, and on a
variety of economic issues like GMO crops, China is our principal ally. On North Korea,
despite differences over tactics, we share the same goal and China is our only effective
partner. On terrorism and crime, China is our principal Asian ally. We are now in a
novel situation where Japan is our military ally and partial ideological soulmate, but
China is effectively our ally on the important political and economic issues, with Japan
either ineffectual or in opposition to us. This is a novel historical situation.<br><br>

Where Chinese influence has increased greatly at our expense, other than the unique
situation in the Taiwan Straits, it has been because we and our traditional allies created a
vacuum, not because China has aggressively asserted power. But there have been
important shifts, and we need to be very conscious of them. On the dangerous North
Korean issue, we have been divided at home, and our allies, most notably South Korea,
have disagreed with our tactics. We have demanded that China play the central role, and
China was hesitant to accept the invitation. In Southeast Asia, we have traditionally
earned loyal support by organizing our policies around a core value of economic growth
through liberalization and globalization. Today we are perceived as having abandoned
that priority in favor of a more military focus on the war on terror, while China is seen
having abandoned its Maoist geopolitical priorities in favor of a priority for mutual
economic development through multilateral liberalization. Within our economic policies
we are seen as having abandoned multilateral liberalization in favor of highly politicized
bilateral free trade agreements, while China has become the principal supporter of
multilateralism. China carefully joined ASEAN on trade, rather than asserting its own
vision. Without exception, Southeast Asian (and many other Asian) elites see the 2003
APEC summit as a watershed that marked the U.S. and Chinese reversal of roles. The
result of these Korean and Southeast Asian developments is a sea change in Asian
geopolitics, but we are the ones who made the changes, not China, and we still can take
the initiative if we wish to do so.<br><br>
We Americans must be very clear about the difference between success and failure.
When our system of institutions and relationships pulls the unstable China of 1870 and
the destructive China of 1970 into coherence, prosperity and support of the major global
institutions that we have created, it is success for us, not failure. In fact, it is one of the
great successes of history. When we have a prosperous economic partner, at the cost of
historically minor adjustments, that is success for us, not failure. Of course, our
successes to date provide no absolute assurance that China will always be friendly or
supportive of our institutions. But if we welcome China’s prosperity, we maximize the
chances of an auspicious outcome. If we reject it, we ensure the worst outcome.
The best outcome for our relationship with a globalized China is that China becomes like
Japan, a prosperous competitor with whom we have a mutually beneficial division of
labor. Hopefully China will absorb useful political lessons from its Asian neighbors, and
hopefully Japan and South Korea will learn the economic lessons of China’s superior openness to our investments. China’s turn to globalization has been one of the greatest
foreign policy triumphs of American history.<br><br>
My first boss was Herman Kahn, who wrote a book called “The Emerging Japanese
Superstate.” Japanese experts constantly worried that, if their economy really succeeded,
we would intervene to put them down. Herman Kahn invariably replied, “You don’t
understand Americans. We won’t attack you. We’ll take credit for everything you
achieve.” Herman Kahn was a great American strategist and a great American patriot.<br><br>
