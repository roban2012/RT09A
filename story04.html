China and India will exercise increasing influence in international affairs in the coming
decades. As prominent members of the G-20, their influence will be manifest in the
global economy, in global politics, and in the global security environment. Each country’s
role on the world stage will also be affected by the progress that it makes and by
the competition and cooperation that develop between them.<br><br>
The research described in this monograph focuses on the progress China and
India seem likely to achieve from 2010 through 2025, as well as on some of the
major problems they may encounter along the way. This research consists of a comparative
assessment of their prospects in this period in four domains: demography,
macroeconomics, science and technology, and defense spending and procurement.
In each domain, the assessment seeks answers to these questions: Who is ahead? By
how much? and Why? Often the answers are quantitative, sometimes they are more
qualitative, and sometimes they are inconclusive. The monograph concludes with
implications for policy and for further research.<br><br>
In view of this scope, this document should be of interest to decisionmakers and
analysts in the executive branch, in Congress, and among the larger public.
This research was sponsored by the Director of Net Assessment in the Office of
the Secretary of Defense and conducted within the International Security and Defense
Policy Center of the RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded
research and development center sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense,
the Joint Staff, the Unified Combatant Commands, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the
defense agencies, and the defense Intelligence Community.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">Summary</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
In the past century, China and India have experienced frequently rivalrous relations,
including two occasions of military conflict in 1956 and 1962, sharp changes in the
issues and venues of their rivalry, and sometimes quite different stances toward the
United States and its policies. These circumstances provide a backdrop for our report,
although our approach is more narrowly focused, while also looking forward to the
two countries’ future prospects rather than to their histories.<br><br>
The purpose of this document is to assess the prospects of India and China
through 2025 in four domains: demography, macroeconomics, science and technology,
and defense spending and procurement. We seek to answer these questions: Who’s
ahead? By how much? and Why? As the second question implies, we strive for quantitative
answers as much as possible. In the process, we try to assess the balance between
advantages and disadvantages that China and India will possess 15 years hence. This
balance is relevant for potential cooperation between the two countries, no less than for
their potential competition and rivalry. Although our focus is on quantitative answers,
we repeatedly acknowledge the uncertainties created for the assessment by such qualitative
unknowns as whether or not each country may encounter internal civil unrest,
political disruption, external conflict, or natural disasters.<br><br>
Demography
Chapter Two begins the comparative assessment by examining the demographic balance.
China and India are the world’s two most populous countries. India’s current
rate of population growth is about twice that of China (1.55 percent annually, versus
0.66 percent for China), and its total population will equal China’s in 2025 (about
1.4 billion in each country), thereafter exceeding China’s. The Indian population will
continue increasing through at least 2050, while China’s will peak at about 1.5 billion
in 2032, declining thereafter.<br><br>
From the standpoint of economic competition between the two countries, the age
composition of their populations is more significant than their aggregate size. India’s
prime-working-age population will overtake that of China in 2028. Moreover, reflecting the changing age composition of their populations, the two countries will experience
very different patterns in their overall dependency ratios―that is, the ratio of the
young and the elderly to those of prime working age. (The dependency ratio concept
assumes that, on average, people aged 15C64 produce more than they consume, while
the opposite is true for those who are younger and older. Rising dependency ratios
are generally viewed as an impediment to economic performance, while falling ratios
are considered an advantage.) Although India’s overall dependency ratio is currently
higher than China’s, the ratio will be rising rapidly in China in the next two decades,
while it will be declining in India.<br><br>
Numerous other factors will affect the balance of demographic advantages and
disadvantages, including the health, education, gender composition, and migration
propensities of the respective populations. For example, China’s population is generally
healthier than India’s, and China has the benefit of a more developed health care
system. On the other hand, China’s population is aging more rapidly than India’s, in
the sense that the elderly are becoming an increasingly larger proportion of China’s
population. India will have a lesser cost burden from this source because of its younger
population.<br><br>
China’s population also has higher average levels of literacy and education than
India’s. If India can successfully meet this challenge by investing in human capital, it
may be able to turn a disadvantage into an advantage through productive employment
of its growing pool of younger workers.<br><br>
The bottom-line answer to the “Who is ahead?” question as it relates to demography
is evidently in India’s favor. However, whether India’s several demographic
advantages―increasing numbers, younger age cohorts, declining dependency ratios―
will be a dividend or drag on future economic growth will depend on the extent to
which productive employment opportunities emerge from an open, competitive,
innovative, and entrepreneurial Indian economy. Conversely, whether China’s several
demographic disadvantages―rapidly aging population, rising dependency ratios,
rising health costs for the elderly, sharp gender imbalances―will be a drag or a dividend
will depend on the extent to which these demographic circumstances provide a
stimulus to improving technology and to raising the skill and productivity of a shrinking
labor force.<br><br>
Macroeconomics<br><br>
In Chapter Three, we assess the macroeconomic balance between India and China
through a meta-analysis of 27 recent studies of the two countries’ prior economic
growth and their forecasted growth through the 2025 period. The studies were selected
from a larger set of 47 studies screened on the basis of the scope and reliability of the
data needed for the meta-analysis. The studies, published between 2000 and 2008,

were from three different types of institutions: academic, business, and international
organizations. The pooled data enabled comparisons to be made between China’s and
India’s forecasted economic performance through 2025 in terms of four salient indicators:
growth of capital, growth of employed labor, growth of total factor productivity,
and growth of gross domestic product (GDP).<br><br>
What is striking about the results is the narrow margins between the paired
China-India comparisons. The forecasted average annual GDP growth rates in 2020C
2025 are approximately the same: China at 5.7 percent, India at 5.6 percent. The corresponding
maximum GDP growth rates of the forecasts are 9.0 percent for China
and 8.4 percent for India, and their paired minimum growth rates are 3.8 percent and
2.8 percent, respectively. Estimates of the other three growth indicators (capital, labor,
total factor productivity) show slightly larger differences.<br><br>
The meta-analysis also included comparisons among the three separate clusters,
covering 11 academic, 9 business, and 7 international organizations. The business cluster’s
forecasts are distinctly more optimistic about India’s growth prospects and relatively
pessimistic about China’s, forecasting an average Indian growth rate of 6.3 percent
and an average Chinese growth rate of 4.7 percent for the 2020C2025 period. The
two other clusters (academic and international organizations) reverse this order, with
markedly higher growth estimates for China than for India. We conjecture that an
expectation of a more favorable business environment in India―for example, relating
to the rule of law and protection of property rights―might account for this difference.
To reflect as well as to bound the uncertainties embedded in the meta-analysis
forecasts, our assessment shows the GDP comparisons between India and China that
result from five differing paired scenarios of their respective high, low, and average
growth rates. Only in the scenario that posits the high-growth parameter for India
and low-growth for China does India’s GDP in 2025 approach that of China. In this
scenario, India’s GDP in 2025 is $12.3 trillion and China’s is $13.8 trillion, employing
purchasing power parity (PPP) rates to convert rupees and renminbi, respectively, to
constant U.S. dollars.<br><br>
We conclude that, concerning forecasted economic growth, our assessment places
the two countries at equivalent rates, but with China’s aggregate GDP likely remaining
substantially larger than India’s through 2025, as is currently their comparative status.<br><br>
Science and Technology<br><br>
We assess the science and technology (S&T) balance between India and China in
Chapter Four. The assessment focuses on several indicators of S&T inputs and two
output indicators. The input indicators include both financial and human resources.
The financial input indicators involve spending on research and development (R&D).
We focus on gross expenditures on R&D (GERD) as a percentage of GDP, as well

as GERD’s four components: higher education R&D spending (HERD), business
R&D spending (BERD), government R&D (GOVERD), and private, nonprofit organizations’
R&D spending (PNPERD). The human resource input indicators are the
number of doctoral degrees in engineering, life sciences, physical sciences, computer
science, mathematics, and agriculture.<br><br>
As output indicators, the assessment compares (1) publications in refereed scientific
journals and (2) patents (especially triadic patents) produced by authors and inventors
from China and from India. We acknowledge that these indicators are incomplete:<br><br>
For example, innovations and improvements in production and management practices
often occur that are not reflected in either scientific publications or patents. Despite
their limitations, these indicators are used in the assessment of Chapter Four to compare
India’s and China’s recent S&T accomplishments and to develop a simulation
model for projecting their future trajectories.<br><br>
China currently has the world’s third-largest GERD (after the United States and
Japan). Also, the business component (BERD), which may have the greatest early effects
on productivity, has increased from 0.25 percent of China’s GDP in 1996 to more than
1 percent in 2006. China’s GERD has subsequently risen further in absolute amounts
and as a share of China’s GDP. India’s GERD is 0.8 percent of GDP; it is expected to
triple in the next five years and to continue to rise through the 2025 period.<br><br>
China currently graduates 70 percent more engineers annually than does India<br><br>
(600,000 and 350,000, respectively). However, there are questions about the reliability
and comparability of these aggregate figures, and another difficulty arises in assessing
the quality of similarly credentialed engineers in the two countries. As an example,
according to a survey of multinational businesses, the quality (“employability”) of
graduate engineers from China is 60 percent less than that of graduate engineers from
India. The simulation model described in Chapter Four uses the input variables mentioned
above, along with cost and output parameters. The parameters are sometimes
based on current levels prevailing in India and China and sometimes based on current
levels in South Korea, on the assumption that the parameter values in China and India
will converge over the next 15 years to the higher levels prevailing in South Korea in
2008. Our assessment includes several simulation scenarios with differing combinations
of these parameter values and differing degrees of optimism and pessimism about
prospective S&T developments in India and China.<br><br>
Whether outputs are registered in terms of full-time science and engineering
researchers, holders of doctoral S&E degrees, triadic patents, or journal publications,
the forecasted answer to the “Who is ahead?” questions is that our estimates for China
exceed those for India by wide margins. The simulation estimates of China’s researchers
and S&E journal publications in 2025 exceed those of India by factors of 8 and
13, respectively. Only in the scenarios in which we adopt the qualitative discount cited

above for China’s graduate engineers and their imputed productivity do these factors
diminish substantially, falling to 1.5 and 1.7, respectively.<br><br>
Spending on Defense and Defense Procurement<br><br>
Comparing spending on defense and defense procurement in India and China
involves problems of data reliability and comparability that are no less difficult than
those encountered in the preceding S&T comparisons. The assessment in Chapter
Five addresses these problems, as well as the additional problem presented by identifiable
gaps in the defense spending and procurement data for both countries. While
these gaps are evident in both cases, they are distinctly larger in China. The approach
adopted in Chapter Five builds on each country’s official data to arrive at estimates of
their total expenditures on defense and on defense procurement, and to express these
as shares of their respective GDPs.<br><br>
Forecasts of these expenditures through 2025 are made using two methods. One
method is based on a continuation of recent year-over-year real growth rates of defense
spending, while the second method assumes that defense spending is a fixed share of
GDP, thereby linking the defense spending estimates to the GDP forecasts provided
in Chapter Three. The first method yields substantially higher forecasts for defense
spending than the second, resulting in budget and GDP shares so high that they would
likely be politically unacceptable in both countries. Each of the two methods was
used to generate three different estimates for China and India, representing optimistic
(“high”), pessimistic (“low”), and moderate (“best”) scenario assumptions.<br><br>
According to the first method, our “best” estimate for India’s defense spending
in 2025 is between $94 billion and $277 billion in 2025, in constant dollars depending,
respectively, on whether market exchange rates or PPP conversion rates are used.
The corresponding “best” estimates for China are between and four and seven times
those for India. As noted earlier, the forecasts resulting from the second, GDP-based
method are appreciably lower, lying between $82 billion and $242 billion for India,
and between two and three times these amounts for China.<br><br>
Turning to spending for defense procurement, we employ a single estimation
method analogous to the year-over-year method cited above for estimating defense
spending through 2025. The method posits a high and fixed (12.8 percent) annual
growth of procurement spending for both countries from 2009 levels. Our resulting
estimates for India’s defense procurement in 2025 are between $63 billion and
$186 billion (in constant dollars), depending on whether market exchange or PPP conversion
rates are used to convert rupees to dollars. The corresponding “best” estimates
for China are about 2.6 times and four times these amounts.<br><br>


Observations and Implications<br><br>
Chapter Six concludes with observations about the four dimensions of the assessment
and with implications that may be drawn from the assessment. We reiterate the abundant
sources of uncertainty surrounding our quantitative estimates and advise caution
in treating our forecasts of economic growth, scientific and technological development,
and defense spending as other than suggesting boundary conditions. While recognizing
the uncertainties, our answers to the original questions about “Who is ahead?” and
about the respective advantages and disadvantages of India and China can be briefly
summarized:<br><br>
  The demographic assessment suggests several distinct advantages for India (these
are delineated in Chapter Two).<br><br>
  The macroeconomic assessment suggests that the economic growth competition
between India and China may be considerably closer than might otherwise be
expected.<br><br>
  In S&T, China’s margins over India are likely to be substantial, deriving largely
from the currently prevailing disparities between them that, in absolute terms,
are likely to grow.<br><br>
  In defense spending and procurement, a similar pattern is likely to emerge: The
two countries show wide disparities in their current spending levels and, in absolute
terms, these are likely to grow substantially over the next 15 years.<br><br>
An important implication follows from the multiple high-versus-low/optimisticversus-
pessimistic scenarios described in our assessment. India and China, by adopting
or failing to adopt suitable policies, can affect significantly the probabilities that
one or another of the alternative scenarios materializes, thereby altering the balance of
advantages and disadvantages between the two countries. For example, if India follows
effective economic and social policies, its favorable demographic trends will result in a
significant “dividend” for the economy’s growth; conversely, if China’s policies were to
fall short of compensating for the adverse demographic trends it faces, the result will
be a significant “drag” on its economic growth.<br><br>
Also, though perhaps to a more limited extent, policies pursued by the United
States and other “third” parties may be able to affect this balance. From this standpoint,
an actionable inference can be drawn: Identify which among the multiple scenarios
sketched in our assessment seems preferable, and develop a portfolio of policies
conducive to enhancing the probability of that (or those) scenario(s) emerging over the
next 15 years.<br><br>
Explicating the specific policies and their effects in altering our forecasted outcomes
is worthy of further attention, as well as beyond the purview of this study. Nonetheless,
we suggest the following proposition: Prospects for India to pursue policies that
will enhance its competitive position vis-à-vis China are better than are the reverse

prospects. This is because India’s political-economic system entails at least a moderately
greater degree of economic freedom than does China’s, and this provides an environment
more conducive to entrepreneurial, innovative, and inventive activity that may
favor India’s position in the long-term competition between the two countries.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">Chapter One Objectives, Background, Context</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
The purpose of this document is to assess the relative levels, attainments, and prospects
of China and India through 2025 in four domains: demography, macroeconomics,
science and technology, and defense spending and procurement. We also seek to identify
impediments and constraints that each country will confront in these domains
through the next 15 years. Simply stated, we try to answer, or at least shed light on, the
following questions: Who is ahead? By how much? and Why?<br><br>
As the second of these questions implies, we mainly, although not exclusively,
strive for quantitative answers. At the same time, we repeatedly acknowledge the many
crucial qualitative factors that may decisively influence the quantitative answers we
seek, such as the occurrence of civil unrest, political disruption, external conflicts, or
natural disasters. But while these omitted factors may have important effects on the
four dimensions we focus on in this study, these effects will not necessarily change the
positions of China and India relative to one another. For example, China may be neither
more nor less subject to civil unrest or political disruption than India.<br><br>
The objectives of this study bring to mind a magisterial study completed a decade
ago, Protracted Contest: Sino-Indian Rivalry in the Twentieth Century (Garver, 2001),
that surveys the complex relations and interactions―including two occasions of
military conflict in 1956 and 1962―between China and India in the past century.
John Garver’s book focuses exhaustively on the history, culture, politics, diplomacy,
and geography of the two countries’ rivalrous relations across a wide range of issues,
including especially those relating to Tibet, Pakistan, Burma, Nepal, other developing
nations, and the Indian Ocean.<br><br>
Garver’s focus is both relevant to and different from that of our study. Its relevance
lies in the fact that the domains addressed in our assessment define and quantify
some of the major capabilities as well as the constraints―both the advantages and
disadvantages―that the two countries would bring to the continued rivalry and the
long-term competition between them in the 21st century, through 2025.
However, our focus also differs from Garver’s because the capabilities and constraints
that we address may affect potential cooperation between India and China,
as well as their rivalry and competition. Further, we explore how the capabilities and

constraints may also influence the United States and other countries in formulating
policies toward both countries.<br><br>
India and China command special attention, not just in Asia (for example, in
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] forum and the Council for Security
Cooperation in the Asia Pacific [CSCAP]) but also in the global economy and in the
biennial, multicountry consultative summit meeting known as the G-20, which is
acquiring growing importance in the international arena. China and India are the
world’s two most populous countries. They have sustained the world’s highest annual
gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates over the past decade―9 percent for China
and 6 or 7 percent for India. The two countries have been among the world’s most
successful in weathering the challenges of the global economy’s Great Recession since
2008. China has accomplished this through a combination of a large government stimulus
program (as a share of its GDP twice as large as that of the United States) and an
effective infrastructure-building program. India’s similarly successful efforts in sustaining
rapid growth despite the global recession have been due to its lesser dependence
on exports to drive its economy and an expansion of domestic demand.<br><br>
The two countries arguably have the greatest influence and leverage among the
ten emerging-market countries in the G-20. Their joint influence has been decisive in
aborting the World Trade Organization’s Doha Development Round of negotiations
on trade liberalization, as well in the failure―whether for good or ill―of the 2009
UN Climate Change Conference (also known as the Copenhagen Summit). China
has become the world’s largest source of net capital outflows (Wolf et al., forthcoming).
India’s popularity as a destination for foreign capital inflows is rapidly increasing,
and India is the world’s largest recipient of foreign outsourcing of computer-based
services.1 China and India are both heavily dependent on imported oil: They are the
world’s second- and fourth-largest importers, respectively. Shifting to a very different
realm, China is the most aggressive opponent of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan autonomy,
while India is their most vigorous supporter.<br><br>
The prominence of India and China in all of these issues is indisputable. But the
relevance of the four domains to each of the above issues varies. The two countries’
demographics have some bearing on most of these issues. China’s and India’s likely
economic growth trajectories affect and are affected by most of them. Science and
technology in the two countries will affect their respective competitive positions in
several of these issues, as will their respective performance in the domain of defense
spending and procurement.<br><br>
While the four domains of our assessment are thus pervasively important and
timely, they are not exhaustive or dispositive. Our assessment ignores, or at best considers
tangentially, numerous circumstantial and institutional factors that may often
dominate the four domains addressed in affecting many issues, whether of rivalry or of

cooperation, between India and China. These exogenous factors include, for example,
the evolution of each country’s domestic politics; the progress of democracy, pluralism,
and the rule of law; civil strife; foreign military hostilities; and the policies of the
United States and other third countries toward India and China. Implicitly, we assume
that these other factors are unchanged, or that such changes as occur will affect India
and China to the same extent. So, caution is warranted in reading predictive validity
into the assessment that follows.<br><br>
The analysis covered in this report has five parts.2 Chapter Two reviews population
trends in China and India. It considers whether the fact that China’s population is
aging much more rapidly than India’s may be a “drag” on China’s economic prospects
and a “dividend” for those of India, or, less likely, that circumstances may arise under
which the reverse effects might ensue. The chapter explores many issues on which this
dividend-versus-drag question depends: the ratios of the young and the elderly to those
of priming working age (dependency ratios) and of males to females (sex ratios) in
the evolving age cohorts, educational demands, health conditions, the role of women,
and the social implications of son preferences and gender imbalances in the societies
and polities of the two countries. The chapter summarizes the balance of comparative
advantages and disadvantages that demographic changes will generate for India and
China in 2025.<br><br>
Chapter Three is a macroeconomic assessment of India’s and China’s economic
growth to date and their prospects through 2025. The core of Chapter Three is a metaanalysis
of 27 separate independent studies, published between 2000 and 2008, of the
major components of and contributors to each country’s growth over the past decade:
namely, growth of capital (i.e., plants and equipment), employed labor, total factor productivity
(i.e., productivity of a weighted combination of capital and labor), and real
growth of each country’s GDP. The collective means, minima, maxima, and variances
of these factors are calculated, and the 27 studies are grouped into three clusters: those
done by academic authors and institutions, by business organizations (e.g., Goldman
Sachs, PricewaterhouseCoopers, McKinsey), and by international organizations (e.g.,
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank).
The meta-analysis highlights several interesting contrasts, as well as some similarities,
among the three clusters. Chapter Three concludes with five differing scenarios among
possible pairings between average, high, and low growth forecasts derived from the
three clusters.<br><br>
Chapter Four organizes available data for India and China on research and development
(R&D) spending in the past decade and each country’s national plan for
increasing it in the coming decade. The data cover four sources of funding: government,
business, higher education, and private nonprofit organizations. These spending


data are complemented by examining both quantitative and qualitative information on
the production and mobilization by China and India of human resources: specifically,
science and engineering graduates, their employment in research, their productivity
(e.g., in patent awards and recorded publications), and their costs. The data are used to
make projections through 2025 based on a constant-returns-to-scale simulation model
driven by each country’s GDP growth estimates derived from the meta-analysis summarized
in Chapter Three. The model is also used to forecast each country’s production
of intellectual property, as represented by triadic patents and publications in refereed
journals. Chapter Four concludes with projections of alternative optimistic and
pessimistic scenarios relating to forecasted productivity and costs of technical researchers
in India and China.<br><br>
Chapter Five addresses the assessment’s fourth domain―spending on defense
and defense procurement. The analysis is mainly based on official government data and
sources for both countries, supplemented by several other invaluable sources. The nonofficial
sources help to identify gaps in official data (especially the relatively larger gaps
in coverage by the Chinese sources) and to highlight differences in how the two countries
define what is included in or excluded from defense spending. For example, China
includes spending for police paramilitary forces in its defense spending, but India does
not. The baseline 2009 estimates and forecasts to 2025 for spending on defense and
defense procurement in Chapter Five are linked to the estimates of GDP and of GDP
growth developed in Chapter Three, and to the estimates of real rates of growth both
in GDP and in defense spending and procurement in the decade between 2000 and
2009, described in Chapter Five. These estimates are calculated in local currency units
(rupees for India, renminbi for China), and U.S. dollars based on market exchange
rates (MXR) and on purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates. Reflecting the
large uncertainties inevitably involved, Chapter Five develops upper, lower, and “best”
(medium) estimates for both China and India covering their total defense spending
and spending on military procurement, linking these bounding estimates to the high
and low GDP growth estimates from Chapter Three and the real rates of growth developed
in Chapter Five, as well as to a range of specified defense-to-GDP ratios.<br><br>
The 2009 baseline defense spending estimates for China are between $110 billion
and $201 billion, depending, respectively, on whether PPP or MXR conversion
rates are used. The corresponding baseline estimates for India are $34 billion and
$101 billion, respectively. The ratio between the two countries’ defense spending in
2009 was between 2.0 and 3.2, in China’s favor. The ratio between the Chinese and
Indian defense procurement 2009 baseline figures is between 2.6 and 4.2.<br><br>
Again reflecting the abundant uncertainties implied by the several scenarios, the
ratio between China’s and India’s defense spending in 2025 might reach as high a
figure as 7.3, or might remain as low as the 2.0 low side of the 2009 baseline estimate.
The corresponding ratio between the two countries’ defense procurement forecasts in
2025 might be as high as 9.5 or as low as 2.6.<br><br>

Finally, Chapter Six draws on Chapters Two through Five to distill answers to the
original questions: Who is ahead? By how much? and Why? Chapter Six summarizes
the competitive advantages and disadvantages of India and China, and their respective
capabilities and constraints, through 2025. The chapter also suggests several policy
implications that stem from the assessment. The conclusions and policy implications
presented in Chapter Six reiterate the grounds for caution regarding the assessment,
both because of the large uncertainties pervading the estimates and because of the
potential influences on the “protracted contest” between the two countries that are not
accounted for in our assessment.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">Chapter Two Population Trends in China and India: Demographic Dividend or Demographic Drag?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Although China is currently more economically advanced than India, its population
is, on average, much older than India’s. Might this be a “demographic drag” that limits
China’s economic prospects relative to those of India? Might India, whose population
is both younger and growing relative to that of China, experience a “demographic dividend”
from these trends? In this chapter, we review recent demographic trends in India
and China and their implications. Our focus is on the years 2020C2025; to put this
period in perspective, we show data for the years 2000C2035. We mostly rely on data
from the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Data Base (IDB) (U.S. Census Bureau,
2010), because of the availability of both historical data (since 1950) and future projections
(through 2050) and because the bureau’s data on China pertain only to mainland
China, which is our focus.1 In addition, the Census Bureau recently updated these data
(in June 2009 for India and in December 2009 for China), making them the most upto-
date data available at the time of our analysis.2 Occasionally, we present data from
other sources on topics not covered by the IDB.<br><br>
Population Growth and Its Components
China and India are the only countries in the world with populations of more than
1 billion. According to the most recent censuses of each nation, there were 1.266 billion
people in China in 2000 (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2005) and
1.029 billion in India in 2001 (Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India,
2001). According to IDB estimates, there are now 1.330 billion people in China and
1.173 billion in India, and population growth rates have been consistently higher in
India than in China since the early 1970s and will remain so for years to come. India’s




population is projected to grow through at least 20503 (when it will be 1.656 billion),
surpassing China in 2025, whereas China’s population is projected to reach a maximum,
of 1.395 billion, in 2026 and to decrease thereafter (Figure 2.1).<br><br>
Calculating the population change for a nation is done by subtracting the number
of deaths from the number of births and adding the net international migration.
Although in the 20th century both nations experienced relatively large migration flows
because of historical events―foreign invasion and civil war in China and the partition
in India―in recent years net migration from these nations has been relatively low.
According to the IDB, in 2009, India, on net, lost five persons to international migration
per 100,000 population, while China lost 33 per 100,000. This leads us to focus
here on other, more predictable events―i.e., births and deaths―that are currently
doing much more to shape the demographics of each nation.<br><br>
At present, in both China and India, the number of births considerably exceeds
the number of deaths. The IDB estimates that in 2010 there will be 16.19 million
births in China, resulting in a crude birth rate (CBR) of 12.17 births per 1,000 population.
There are estimated to be just over half as many deaths in 2010―9.17 million―
resulting in a crude death rate (CDR) of 6.89 deaths per 1,000 population. The difference
between births and deaths, which is called natural increase, is even greater in
India, where an estimated 25.03 million births are expected in 2010, resulting in a

CBR of 21.34 per 1,000, but only 8.83 million deaths, resulting in a CDR of 7.53 per
1,000.<br><br>
Components of national population growth in 2010, including net immigration,
are shown in Table 2.1. The IDB estimates that China’s population will increase by
0.49 percent in 2010, while India’s will increase by 1.38 percent. (By comparison,
the U.S. population―bolstered by net immigration of 4.25 per 1,000 population―is
expected to grow 0.97 percent in 2010.) Table 2.1 shows that India’s higher rate of
population growth is largely due to its considerably higher CBR, though the difference
in the net immigration rate also contributes modestly. We will now examine the trends
in births and deaths in the two countries.<br><br>

<a href= "pic06.html">Total Population Sizes, and China and India, 2000C2035</a><br><br>

Birth Rates<br><br>
The CBR in India is projected to exceed that in China over the entire 2000C2035
period (Figure 2.2). During the 2020C2025 period, the CBR difference between the
two countries is projected to be slightly smaller (7.2 to 7.4 births per 1,000 population
difference) than what it is in 2010 (9.2 per 1,000), and it will shrink to 6.4 per 1,000
by 2035.<br><br>
During the 2000C2035 period, the CBR in India is projected to decrease smoothly,
from 26.0 per 1,000 to 15.0 per 1,000. In contrast, the CBR in China fell from 12.9
to 11.4 between 2000 and 2006 but is expected to increase to 12.3 in 2011C2012,
after which it will decline again, to 8.6 in 2035. The slight CBR increase projected for
China between 2006 and 2011 is an “echo effect” of the postCCultural Revolution
baby boom; i.e., the women born during that period are now having babies.
The total fertility rate (TFR), the average number of lifetime births per woman,
is a measure of fertility that is not affected by the number of women of childbearing
age in the population, and the TFR is thus considered a better measure than the CBR
for comparing fertility levels between countries or time periods. China’s TFR has been
lower than India’s for many years (Figure 2.3). The IDB estimates that in 2010 the
TFR in India is 2.65 children per woman, while in China it is 1.54; i.e., each Chinese
woman is currently having, over the course of her lifetime, an average of more than one

fewer child than each Indian woman is. The IDB estimates that the TFR in India will
decrease very gradually to “replacement level”―the level needed for population stabilization
in the long run (approximately 2.1 children per woman)―by 2035.<br><br>
By contrast, the TFR in China has been below replacement level since 1991.4 The
IDB estimates that the TFR in China decreased to 1.5 children per woman in 2003
but projects that it will start to increase toward 1.6 as we approach 2035. As a result,
throughout the period we consider, India’s TFR remains higher than China’s, though
the difference between the two countries will decrease over time. By 2025, women in
India are projected to average 0.65 children more than those in China; and in 2050 the
difference is projected to be 0.45 children.<br><br>
The number of births in a country depends not only on the number of births
per woman of childbearing age but also on the number of women in this age range.
The size of the female population that is of childbearing age (ages 15C49) is currently
greater in China than in India (Figure 2.4). However, the number of women of childbearing
age in India is projected to increase over the entire 2000C2035 period (and

until at least 2050), leading to positive “momentum,” while that number has already
begun to decrease in China, resulting in negative momentum. India is projected to
overtake China in total number of women of childbearing age in 2017. This is why the
relative difference in future CBRs shown in Figure 2.2 is considerably greater than that
for TFRs in Figure 2.3. (See DaVanzo, Dogo, and Grammich [forthcoming] for more
information on fertility trends in China and India, including the role of the one-child
policy in China.)<br><br>
Death Rates<br><br>
India’s CDR is currently higher than China’s, and this has been the situation since at
least 2000 (Figure 2.5); however, China’s CDR is projected to surpass India’s in 2014.
China’s CDR began increasing in 2006 and is projected to continue doing so at an
increasing rate over the period of interest. India’s CDR is projected to decrease until
2020C2021, after which it will increase slightly. The CDR difference between the two
countries is projected to grow throughout the 2000C2035 period, leading to increasingly
lower population growth rates in China relative to India.<br><br>
The CDR is strongly affected by the age composition of a population. Indeed,
one reason why CDRs will be higher in China than in India after 2013 is that China’s
population is, on average, older, and older people are more likely to die than younger
people. A better measure for comparing mortality risks or overall health between countries
and across time periods is life expectancy at birth (LEB)―the number of years
that a person born in a given year can expect to live if the age-specific mortality rates

of that year apply throughout that person’s life. LEB has been increasing in both countries
and is expected to continue to do so through at least 2035 (Figure 2.6). LEB is
currently higher in China (74.5 years) than in India (66.5). Death rates from communicable,
maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions are higher in India than in
China for every single cause (WHO, 1999). The LEB gap will narrow somewhat in the
future, but LEB in India will lag behind China for the foreseeable future. In fact, it
will not be until 2038 that India’s LEB will equal the LEB in China today (74.5 years).<br><br>
Population Growth Rates<br><br>
In both China and India, the gap between births and deaths is narrowing, resulting in
slower population growth in both nations, as shown in Figure 2.7. Population growth
rates are expected to be lower in China than in India throughout the 2000C2035
period. India’s population growth rate has been declining since before 2000 and is
expected to do so at about the same rate throughout the period shown. By contrast,
although China’s population growth rate is considerably lower than India’s, China’s
rate is quite flat between 2002 and 2011 but is expected to fall somewhat more rapidly
than India’s thereafter. Beginning in 2027, the number of deaths in China is expected
to exceed the number of births, resulting in natural population loss.<br><br>

Age-Sex Structure of the Population<br><br>
The trends in fertility and mortality discussed above affect the present and projected
age distribution of a population. Demographers typically use population pyramids
to depict the age and sex structure of a population. Such figures are called pyramids
because, historically for most nations, particularly in those with persistently high fertility
rates, they resemble a pyramid, with a wide base representing large numbers of
younger age groups and more narrow bands near the top representing smaller numbers
of older people near the end of their natural life span. In Figure 2.8 we show population
pyramids for India and China for the years 2000, 2010, 2025, and 2035. The
Indian age-sex structure in 2000 is a good example of the classic pyramid shape.
The pyramid shape can still be seen for the 2010 population of India. Because
India’s fertility rate remains above replacement level and the number of women of
childbearing age has been increasing, each birth cohort is larger than the one above it
in the population pyramid, though the widths of the “steps” between adjacent bands
are smaller for the most recent birth cohorts.<br><br>
As we go forward, the base (ages 0C4) of the pyramid for India in 2025 is not
quite as wide as was it for 2010 (reflecting fewer births in the later year), but above age
20 the bars are all much wider than they are now for those age groups. In 2035, fertility
in India is expected to fall nearly to replacement level, and the number of women
who are of childbearing age will level off. As a result, the total number of births will

stop increasing, and younger cohorts will become slightly smaller than those immediately
older.<br><br>
The “pyramids” for China have much smaller bases than those for India, especially
in future years, and are much more jagged in shape. Each of the pyramids for
China has two population bulges. In 2010, there is a bulge for those aged 35C49 (who
were born between 1961 and 1975), which reflects the rapid increase in fertility that
followed the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and the three subsequent “Black Years” of
famine from 1959 to 1961. The smaller cohorts of persons aged 25C34 in 2010 (born
between 1976 and 1985) likely reflect China’s renewal of family planning campaigns in
1971. The large number of persons aged 15C24 in 2010 (who were born between 1986
and 1995) may reflect legal changes in the marriage age that led to earlier marriages
and childbirth, ironically shortly after the introduction of the one-child policy, as well
as some population momentum from persons born in the 1960s who then married and
had children in the 1980s. The small cohorts born in recent years reflect the low fertility
rate following the implementation of the one-child policy.<br><br>
The “bulges” of the Chinese population pyramid will move upward in coming
years as the large cohorts age. For example, in 2035, the large cohort that is now 35C49
will be 60C74. In 2035 there will be many more older people than there are now; for
example, there are projected to be 103 million people in China aged 65C69, compared
with 40 million in 2010.<br><br>
Working-Age and Dependent Populations<br><br>
All these changes in population age composition will affect the percentage of the population
that is of working age (typically defined as ages 15C64)―members of the population
who can (but not necessarily will) contribute to the economy―as well as the
percentage of population that is of “dependent” age (0C14 and 65+), presumed to be
too young or too old to support themselves through labor market activity and who
therefore need to be supported by others, typically the family or the state.5<br><br>
Youth<br><br>
The percentage of the population that is young (under age 15) is projected to be higher
in India than in China throughout the 2000C2035 period, though this percentage is
projected to decrease steadily in both countries (Figure 2.9). The difference between
the countries is currently at its maximum and will be smaller in the 2020C2025 period
(average of 8.8 percent) than it is now (12.2 percent).<br><br>

Working-Age Population<br><br>
China has had a larger percentage of its population that is of working age than India
since the mid-1970s (Ahya et al., 2006). Furthermore, as seen in Figure 2.9, in the first
decade of this century this percentage was increasing more rapidly in China than in
India. This is largely due to the large number of people born in China in the 1960s and
early 1970s who were joined in the workforce by their children born in the 1980s and
early 1990s (demographic echo effect), as evidenced by the corresponding bulges in the
population pyramids shown in Figure 2.8. The percentage of the population of China
that is of working age is expected to peak now and to decrease after 2011 (except for
a very slight increase in 2026C2027 (the last period when the large postCGreat Leap
cohorts will still be of working age).<br><br>
The trend in the percentage of the population that is of working age is more linear
in India, with increases in this indicator reflecting steady, nearly linear decreases in
the fertility rate. The percentage of the population that is of working age in India is
expected to crest around 2030―the same year that India will surpass China on this
statistic―and then decline very slowly, reflecting an expectation of decreasing fertility.
It is important to note that this decline in India will be very gradual, compared with
a much steeper rate of decline in China. (The percentage varies by less than one point
in India over the 2019C2035 period, whereas it decreases by 6.2 points in China over
the same period.) The difference between the two countries in the percentage of the

population that is of working age is currently at its maximum (73.4 percent in China,
64.6 percent in India).<br><br>
Another indicator of the overall shift in balance between the two countries is
that the total number of people of working age in India is projected to overtake that
of China in 2028 (when there are projected to be 971 million people of working age
in India and 956 million in China [U.S. Census Bureau, 2010]). Furthermore, around
this time the working-age population in India will be younger than that in China
(Figure 2.10), providing the foundation for growth but also creating a need for entrylevel
jobs. Meanwhile, there will be more people aged 35C64 (and especially aged
50C64) in China. Nonetheless, it is important to note that throughout our period
of focus, 2020C2025, the percentage of the population that is of working age will be
larger in China (70.6 percent in 2020, 69.2 percent in 2025) than in India (67.0 percent
in 2020, 67.5 percent in 2025), albeit older.<br><br>
Older Population<br><br>
In 2010, 5.3 percent of India’s population and 8.6 percent of China’s is aged 65 or older.
In both countries, this percentage will increase, and at an increasing rate (Figure 2.9).
By 2025, these numbers will be 7.7 percent in India and 14.3 percent in China, and
by 2035 they will be 10.2 percent and 21.0 percent, respectively. By 2035, both China
and India will have more than twice as many older people in relative terms as they do
now (and an even higher ratio in absolute terms).<br><br>

India in every age subgroup, and they will be relatively older (see Figure 2.11 for data
for 2025). Currently, a higher proportion of elders (people aged 65+) is of age 75 or
older in China (37.4 percent) than in India (29.9 percent). The difference will narrow
considerably by 2025 (when the figures will be 35 percent and 32 percent, respectively).
In 2025, both countries will have higher proportions of their elderly who are aged 85
or older (6.6 percent in China and 5.1 percent in India) than they do now (5.8 percent
and 3.6 percent, respectively), meaning that the elderly population will be more frail
than it is now and thus more difficult to take care of.<br><br>
Dependency Ratios<br><br>
The trends in the working-age and dependent populations just presented determine the
trends in dependency ratios, i.e., ratios of persons of “dependent” ages to those of “working”
age. The dependency ratio can be decomposed into the part for youth dependents
(under age 15) and that for old dependents (age 65+).<br><br>
At present in China, there are 36.2 dependents for every 100 persons of working
age. Of these dependents, 67 percent are youths and 33 percent are at least age
65. The youth dependency ratio has decreased in recent years, as a result of absolute
decreases in the number of persons under 15 years of age (which is a result of a decreas-

and 2022 (due to the current increase in the natural birth rate) and decline thereafter
(Figure 2.12).<br><br>
The old-age dependency ratio has increased modestly in China in recent years,
in part because of improvements in survival to older ages. The ratio is currently 11.8
elderly dependents per 100 persons of working age but is projected to rise rapidly and
surpass the youth dependency ratio by 2029, as persons born shortly after the 1949
revolution and before the implementation of family planning programs reach the age
of 65. In 2035, there will be 10.8 more elderly dependents than young dependents for
every 100 people of working age.<br><br>
The pattern in dependency ratios is quite different in India. At 46.6 people under
age 15 for every 100 of working age, India’s 2010 youth dependency ratio is nearly
twice that of China’s (24.4). India has fewer old-age dependents than China, but the
difference between the two countries in their old-age dependency ratios (8.3 for India,
11.8 for China) is much smaller than it is for youth dependents. Currently, 85 percent
of India’s dependents are youths, compared with 67 percent in China. India’s youth
dependency ratio has been decreasing slowly in recent years and is projected to continue
a slow, steady decrease throughout our study period, to 33.2 in 2035. India’s oldage
dependency ratio is projected to increase slowly over the study period, but the rate
of change will increase over time. Nonetheless, even by 2035 there will be more than
twice as many youth dependents as old-age dependents in India.<br><br>

The overall dependency ratio for China is still falling, but it is expected to begin
increasing in 2012 (Figure 2.13), due to continuing increases in the old-age dependency
ratio. Throughout the next two decades, India’s overall dependency ratio will
remain greater than China’s; India’s overall dependency ratio will fall below China’s in
2030. As with every demographic indicator we have considered, changes in India are
projected to be less rapid and smoother than those in China.<br><br>
Sex Ratios
Another demographic trend that may have social implications for China and India is
a growing ratio of males to females. This can be seen in the population pyramids in
Figure 2.8 (in the wider widths for males than females for most age groups) and in the
sex ratios in Figure 2.14. In both China and India, a preference for sons coupled with
decreasing fertility has contributed to a higher ratio of males to females among successively
younger cohorts (Das Gupta et al., 2003; Lane, 2004; Poston, 2002). Most
parents in China or India want to have at least one son. When they decide (or are
encouraged) to have fewer children, they sometimes assess the sex of their fetus and
abort those shown to be female (Visaria, 2004; Dyson, 2004; Jha et al., 2006). The fact
that the ratios of males to females are much larger at all ages in China and India than

in the United States has been taken as evidence that sex-selective abortion is practiced
or that girls are not treated as well as boys, or both.6<br><br>
Opportunity to Reap a Demographic Dividend<br><br>
An increasing proportion of the population that is of working age provides an opportunity
to reap a “demographic dividend” (Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla, 2003), through
both brute force increase in the numbers of potential workers and an accelerated accumulation
of capital due to reduced spending on dependents. Demographic dividends
are estimated to have accounted for one-fourth to two-fifths of East Asian per capita
GDP growth in late 20th century (Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla, 2003).<br><br>
The proportion of the population that is of working age will be higher in China
than in India until 2030. However, the opportunity to reap a demographic dividend
comes from the positive change in the proportion of the population that is in the labor

force, which creates the demand and supply signals necessary for economic growth
(Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla, 2003). The proportion of the population of China that
is of working age is projected to peak during the next two years and then decrease thereafter
(except for a flattening in the mid-2020s, which is just before the postCGreat Leap
baby boom reaches age 65). In India, however, the proportion of the population that is of
working age will increase through 2029 and then decrease slowly but steadily afterward.
China’s demographic window of opportunity is rapidly closing, while India’s will
remain open until at least 2030 (and changes immediately thereafter will be very small).
Bloom et al. (2009) find that economic growth in China and India between 1980
and 2000 was mainly due to increasing productivity, in large part because of the shift
from agriculture to industry and services, but that increases in the proportion of the
population that is of working age and in labor force participation rates contributed
significantly as well. While the effect of the change in the working-age proportion
would, other things the same, favor India, Bloom et al. (2009) find that the level of
working-age population percentage also matters, favoring China in the years leading
up to 2030.<br><br>
India’s working-age population is and will continue to be younger than
China’s. Younger workers are generally more vigorous and adaptive (Lallemand and
Rycx, 2009), and in developing countries they are typically better educated than older
workers, but they can be a source of drag if jobs are not available for them. However,
an older workforce may not be particularly problematic for China as it tries to develop
a post-industrial economy: Recent research (Bloom, Prskawetz, and Lutz, 2007) suggests
that productivity may not decline as much with age for more highly cognitive
tasks as it does for physical tasks.<br><br>
Though growth in the working-age population provides an opportunity for a
country to reap a demographic dividend, the extent to which this occurs depends on
the socioeconomic and policy environment (Figure 2.15). Obviously, there must be a
demand for the increased supply of labor, and conditions must enable its productivity.
This requires effective policies in key areas, including strong health and educational
systems to increase the productivity of potential workers; flexibility and competitiveness
in the labor market to enable it to absorb the “boom” generations; openness to
trade that leads to a growth of productive and rewarding jobs; modern infrastructure
and technology to reduce transactions costs and enable economic efficiency; good governance,
stable macroeconomics, and a sound financial system to promote savings and
investment; and low levels of crime and corruption, which can impede economic progress.
Those forecasting the extent of economic growth for China and India note the
need for conditions similar to those needed to reap a demographic dividend (Wilson
and Purushothaman, 2003; National Intelligence Council, 2004).<br><br>

A “second dividend” may arise when the anticipation of population aging incentivizes
savings and capital accumulation, but this will not occur if old-age security
relies on wealth transfer schemes (Mason and Lee, 2006). Currently, the elderly in
both China and India tend to rely overwhelmingly on families for old-age support. In
2006, only 15 percent of Chinese workers were enrolled in pension plans (Cai, 2006),
with a net present value of unfunded liabilities exceeding current annual GDP (Eberstadt,
2005). India faces a similar problem; a 2001 study estimated that only 10C11
percent of India’s workers had participated in any form of a guaranteed retirement
income system (Gillingham and Kanda, 2001).8<br><br>

There are no publicly available forecasts that enable us to compare China and
India on the presence of all of these conditions. In the sections that follow, we present
some recent data on education, health, the role of women, and infrastructure to explore
how the two countries differ in key factors that will condition how their demographics
will affect their economic prospects.<br><br>
Education<br><br>
Large portions of the population that will be of working age in 2020C2025 have already
completed their schooling, and those currently in school and recent graduates will be
important contributors to this group.<br><br>
Currently, the population of China is better educated than that of India. In
2002C2003, the most recent year for which data are available, China had higher
rates of enrollment at all levels (95 percent vs. 82 percent for net primary enrollment,
70 percent vs. 53 percent for gross secondary enrollment, and 16 percent vs. 12 percent
for gross tertiary enrollment)9 and a considerably higher adult literacy rate (91 percent
versus 61 percent) (Goldman, Kumar, and Liu, 2008).<br><br>
Furthermore, data suggest that the “quality” of schooling is better in China: In
2002C2003, China had a considerably lower average primary pupil-per-teacher ratio
than India (17.6 versus 40.2) and spent more per student, especially on secondary
education.10 Improving the quality of education is one of the goals of the 12-year plan
announced in China in 2008 (“China Solicits Public Opinions on 12-Year Plan for
Education,” 2009). By contrast, India is focusing on improving access to education and
is just now making investments in such basics as walls, toilets, and running water in
schools for all pupils (Ministry of Human Resource Development, 2008). Therefore,
the smaller cohorts entering the Chinese labor force between 2020 and 2025 will be
better educated than the larger ones in India, placing China at an advantage.
Brain drain from both China and India has been considerable, effectively skimming
off the most productive elements of each society. For example, since 1978, more
than 70 percent of all the Chinese who traveled abroad to study have not returned
home (“China Hit by Brain Drain,” 2007), and approximately two-thirds of those

who emigrate from India have some college education (Vonderheid, 2002). It is possible
that improving economic conditions may lure some emigrants to return (Dyson
and Visaria, 2004).<br><br>
Health<br><br>
Health affects not only life expectancy and mortality rates, and hence population
growth rates, but also the extent to which working-age people become productive contributors
to the economy. Healthy older people may be able to contribute to the economy
even after they otherwise might have retired, while improvements in health and
longevity can motivate people to save more for retirement (Bloom et al., 2009). The
health of a population affects its demand for health care and the resources devoted
to it.<br><br>
Health data for recent years and those projected for the future suggest that the
advantage on this dimension goes to China. As of 2004, the average Chinese was
healthier than the average Indian (Chatterji et al., 2008). The burden of disease, measured
in years of “healthy” life lost, is about 50 percent higher in India (355 years per
1,000 people) than in China (260 years per 1,000 people).11 As another example, onesixth
(16.6 percent) of respondents in China and nearly half (46.9 percent) in India
report having at least one chronic condition (Chatterji et al., 2008). Death rates from
communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions are higher for India
than for China for every single cause (WHO, undated).<br><br>
India has a high death rate from infectious and parasitic diseases―many times
higher than in China; controlling those will help improvements in life expectancy
continue in both countries (see Cook and Dummer, 2004, for China and Horton,
2001, for India). Long-term trends, however, will mainly be affected by how well each
nation controls “civilization diseases” resulting from its socioeconomic development.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both countries. Cancer accounts
for nearly 20 percent of all deaths in China, but only 7 percent in India. Respiratory
disease is an important cause of death in India, and to a lesser degree in China (see epidemiology
data in He et al., 2005, for China and Joshi et al., 2006, for India). Deaths
due to respiratory disease may increase in both countries as pollution increases. By one
estimate (Havely, 2005), China has seven of the ten most polluted cities in the world.
The World Health Organization (WHO) rates New Delhi as the fourth most polluted
city in the world in terms of suspended particulate matter (Gadhok, n.d.).
HIV/AIDS is another factor that will affect trends in life expectancy. Mortality
from HIV/AIDS was estimated to be much higher in India (18 per 100,000 population)
than in China (0.6 per 100,000) in the late 1990s, but the disease is expanding

rapidly in both nations (UNAIDS, 2006a, 2006b). In 2007 (the most recent year for
which data are available), India was estimated to have 2.31 million persons living with
AIDS, the highest total of any country in the world, though its prevalence rate among
adults, 0.34 percent, is much lower than the 20 to 30 percent in the most-affected
countries in Africa (National AIDS Control Organisation, 2007). The corresponding
numbers are much smaller for China: 650,000 persons living with AIDS and a prevalence
rate of 0.1 percent, although this is believed to be increasing rapidly (Gordon,
2002). In both nations, AIDS is geographically concentrated, primarily in southern
regions and in areas attracting migrants.<br><br>
Chatterji et al. (2008) project that the number of healthy years lost will decline
in China for all broad categories of diseases, indicating that, though older, the population
of China will be healthier. As India transitions from communicable to noncommunicable
diseases dominating, they project that the number of healthy years lost will
increase for noncommunicable causes.<br><br>
Per capita health expenditures nearly doubled in China between 2000 and 2006
(WHO, 2006), and increased by more than 50 percent in India over the same period
(WHO, 2009). Furthermore, the WHO expects these costs to keep increasing in the
decades to come. Because health care costs increase significantly with age, the burden
of the older population will be significantly larger for China than for India, though, as
noted above, currently elders are healthier in China than in India.<br><br>
Women in the Economy<br><br>
A significant determinant of future economic growth in both countries will be the
degree to which women participate in the formal economy (Apps and Rees, 2001;
Bloom et al., 2009; Fortin, 2009). In both countries, women are much less likely to
participate in the formal labor force than men are, but the difference is much greater
in India. In 2006, 69 percent of women in China participated in the formal economy,
while in India the rate was only 34 percent (Cook and Chen, 2007).<br><br>
Attitudes regarding women’s roles are presently more permissive in China than
in India. For example, 87 percent of Chinese respondents to the World Values Survey
feel that a university education is as important for a girl as for a boy, compared with
50 percent in India (World Values Survey Association, 2009; DaVanzo, Dogo, and
Grammich, forthcoming). As a consequence, China appears better positioned than
India to welcome women into the formal workforce.<br><br>
Females lag behind males in literacy and educational attainment in both countries,
but this is particularly so in India (Goldman, Kumar, and Liu, 2008). In 2000C2001,
women in China trailed men in adult literacy by eight percentage points (87 percent
versus 95 percent), whereas in India the difference was 25 percentage points (48 percent
versus 73 percent). In 2000, less than half of adult women in India were literate.
Not only does educating women prepare them to be productive members of the labor
force, it also has the additional effects of reducing the number of children desired

(which may be useful in India but moot in China because of its one-child policy) and
promoting investments in their children’s health and education (World Bank, 2009).
Though women in both countries will have fewer responsibilities for child care
because of declining fertility, as the populations age, work opportunities for women
may be constrained by the need to provide care to elderly parents and parents-in-law, a
responsibility they will share with fewer, if any, siblings.<br><br>
Infrastructure<br><br>
A well-developed infrastructure can reduce transactions costs, enable economic efficiency,
increase the productivity of labor, and alleviate limitations of an aging society
by easing movement and extending productivity into later years. The construction of
such infrastructure can also provide employment opportunities.<br><br>
China ranks considerably ahead of India on many dimensions of infrastructure,
especially those related to communications and energy. This was not always so; it is a
result of a recent, systematic campaign of reinvesting national savings into infrastructure,
resulting in rapid growth over the 1980C2005 period. This is a pattern followed
by other authoritarian, high-growth economies in Asia, where centrally planned infrastructure
is systematically built ahead of demand, promoting export-oriented growth
(Akteruzzaman, 2006).<br><br>
India, by contrast, has taken a less comprehensive and more decentralized
approach to infrastructure development, a result of its democratic governance structure,
lower GDP, and consistent fiscal deficit. The rate of investment in physical infrastructure
as a percentage of GDP has consistently fallen since the early 1990s in India,
resulting in an increasing gap between India and China. For example, China’s annual
investment in its road network increased from about US$1 billion in 1991 to around
$38 billion in 2002 (Kim and Nangia, 2008). With over 30,000 km of expressways,
China is rapidly catching up with the United States, which has the world’s largest road
network. In response to the 2008 financial crisis, the Chinese government created a
4 trillion renminbi (approximately US$586 billion) stimulus plan, 38 percent of which
went to infrastructure investment. The combination of continued investment and targeted,
efficient stimulus funding will result in China adding 5,000 km of expressway
every year. By comparison, India’s existing national highway network is slow and heavily
congested. The story is similar for other infrastructure sectors (Kim and Nangia,
2008). A recent study by McKinsey and Co. (Gupta, Gupta, and Netzer, 2009) concluded
that there are severe inefficiencies in the government implementation of infrastructure
projects in India and that these may cost India up to 10 percent of potential
GDP in 2017C2018.<br><br>

Other Implications of Changes in Population Age-Sex Composition
Implications of Gender Imbalances and the Changing Composition of “Dependents”
Some have speculated that many of the “excess men” in China and India will not be
able to find wives, resulting in a “bachelor bomb” that could lead to social instability
and violent crime and foster an authoritarian political system to control perceived
increases in violence by such males, lead to larger armies that pursue expansionist
policies, or even cause public health problems because of more widespread prostitution
(Hudson and den Boer, 2004; Poston and Morrison, 2005). Such arguments, however,
may not sufficiently acknowledge the possibility that differences in age at marriage for
men and women may increase; that is, men may still marry, but at older ages, while
women may marry at younger ages. “Excess” men may also emigrate, or brides may be
“imported” from other countries. A recent study of China (Edlund et al., 2007), however,
did find that regions with higher sex ratios have higher rates of crime.<br><br>
The contrasting composition of dependency ratios in each nation indicates that
issues related to youth, such as education, will be more prominent in India, while issues
regarding the elderly, such as pensions and geriatric health care, will be more prominent
in China. It is not clear whether China has dedicated the resources necessary to
support larger numbers of the elderly with fewer youths. State-owned enterprises that
traditionally funded social programs for workers and their families have largely collapsed,
and no national social welfare system has yet replaced them.<br><br><br><br>
Elderly in both India and China traditionally rely on family members to care for
them in their old age. With fewer children, parents may expect less support from their
families. When the parents of the only children born under China’s one-child policy
reach old age, they will have, at most, one surviving child to support them, and if that
child is a daughter who follows long-standing cultural norms, she may give more attention
to her husband’s parents than to her own. In 2025, roughly 30 percent of Chinese
women at least 60 years of age will have never born a son (Eberstadt, 2005). If the sex
imbalance results in an increase in the percentage of men who do not marry, this will
mean that many elderly will not have a daughter-in-law to help take care of them. The
sex ratios shown above suggest that parents continue to have strong preferences for
having sons. It remains to be seen whether these attitudes will change under pressure
from demographics. Recent evidence from rural China indicates that the incidence
of young couples residing with the wife’s parents has been increasing (Shuzhuo and
Xiaovi, 2004).<br><br>
If children migrate to areas of greater economic opportunity and leave their parents
behind, the assistance to parents may change from coresidence and other types
of nonmonetary support to monetary transfers, which can be used to purchase goods
and services that would have been provided by family members. Alternatively, if adult

children decide not to migrate or join the modern labor force in order to take care of
their parents, opportunities for economic growth may be constrained.12<br><br>
Implications for the Armed Forces<br><br>
Both countries have, and will continue to have, very large military-age populations
(18C49) and are unlikely to face a shortage of people available for military service, per
se. However, the underlying social and economic changes may change the internal culture
of the people in the military and by extension the militaries themselves.<br><br>
At present, most of the conscripts in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA)
are the only children in their families, and their representation has been increasing
with the entry of the one-child policy cohorts into service, from 20.6 percent in 1996
to 52.4 percent in 2006 (Li, 2001). A study by the PLA found that although “onechild”
soldiers are no different from their siblinged comrades in certain aspects, such
as personality, training records, and service achievement, they do have a higher prevalence
of individualism, egocentricity, and risk aversion, underscoring the importance
of the “political work” required by the party wing to adequately socialize these soldiers
into the military (Finkelstein and Gunnes, 2006, p. 29).<br><br>
Officer reenlistments for only-child personnel are likely to be affected by greater
economic opportunity and the need to provide for elderly parents, potentially reducing
the long-term quality of the non-commissioned officer corps. This is part of an overall
decrease in the level of prestige enjoyed by the military in a rapidly modernizing Chinese
economy, where the armed forces no longer serve as one of only a few ladders for
social advancement.<br><br>
However, the increasing sophistication of the Chinese society brings along a more
technologically attuned pool of labor into the military. The ability of the PLA to harness
and mobilize that potential will depend on the status of civilian-military relations
and the incentives offered by the defense establishment. Improving both of these elements
will require additional investments in manpower, further raising the cost of
maintaining an advanced military force. The importance of these factors is likely to
increase and become more acute during the 2020C2025 time frame.<br><br>
India’s military will not face the same fertility-induced social problems as China’s,
as India’s fertility rate is still above replacement level, and it is the babies born around
2000C2005 who will be the new conscripts in 2020C2025. However, India will face
problems similar to China’s in officer and highly technical cadre accession and retention,
as the broader economy will be more strongly competing with the military for
talent. This may even be more acute in India, because the higher levels of income disparity13
will shrink the available pool of highly qualified candidates, thus increasing

the competition and raising the wages that the military will have to offer in order to
attract top talent necessary for a military proficient in the full spectrum of warfare.<br><br>
Regional Differences<br><br>
Given the enormous geographic sizes of these two nations, it is not surprising that there
is considerable variation by region within them. Within China, dependency ratios are,
and are likely to remain, most favorable for economic growth in the more densely populated
urban areas in the east. In China’s most urbanized provinces, total fertility rates
are considerably below replacement level, average health status is much better than in
rural areas, and large numbers of migrant laborers from rural areas are helping to sustain
economic growth. In contrast, rural areas are aging as working-age people move to
cities, leaving the elderly behind. Rural-to-urban migration may be affecting not only
care of the elderly in China and India, but also other aspects of family life (e.g., the
likelihood of marriage, whether those who marry live together).<br><br>
Within India, total fertility rates have been below replacement level since the
mid-1990s in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, but some northern states still have total fertility
rates over four children per woman. These northern states are poor and have weak
infrastructure, educational systems, and governance, limiting their ability to absorb
the upcoming increase in the working-age population as productive members of the
labor force (Acharya, 2003).<br><br>
AIDS is geographically concentrated in both nations, primarily in southern
regions and in areas attracting migrants (UNAIDS, 2006a; National AIDS Control
Organisation, 2007).<br><br>
In both countries, barring a substantial increase in the extent of internal migration,
such regional variation means that the evolving demographic conditions that aid
or hinder economic growth are likely to affect different regions at different times. To
date, India has experienced relatively low rates of internal migration, perhaps because
children tend to be educated in the local language of each region and hence often do
not have language capabilities to work in other areas. This may change as the country
realizes that it may need to overcome regional parochialism in order to promote economic
growth.<br><br>
Since 1990, China has had a higher proportion of its population living in urban
areas than India, and China is continuing to urbanize more rapidly than India
(Figure 2.16). The United Nations Population Division estimates that in 2007 China’s
population was 42.0 percent urban while India’s was only 28.7 percent urban; it projects
that China will have an urban majority by 2020, something India will not reach
until well after 2040 (UNPD, 2009a, 2009b).<br><br>
Great urban population concentrations in China could, arguably, make it easier
for China to provide social services as well as to develop the economy with lesser

need of extending national infrastructure to hinterlands. With an estimated 5 million
persons leaving farms to move to cities each year in China (Bergsten et al., 2006),
however, there are questions about the ability of the labor market to absorb them and
whether they will overwhelm existing infrastructure. Further analysis is needed of
regional variations and of the potential for internal migration to lessen (or exacerbate)
regional inequalities.<br><br>
Uncertainties and Alternative Scenarios<br><br>
The data we have presented in this chapter are projections of future demographics in
China and India (and estimates of demographics in the recent past). We have used
what we believe are the best data currently available, but it is important to keep in
mind that these data are based on assumptions about the future (and the past) which
may or may not prove to be correct (for example, regarding the impact of HIV/AIDS
in the future). In particular, there has long been debate about fertility levels in China,
due largely to questions about the extent of birth and child underreporting. Because
the impacts of assumptions and uncertainties on estimates of the population size and
distribution can be profound, we are implored to mention them.<br><br>
Assumptions about demographics and uncertainties about the future have led to
a wide range of population changeCbased scenarios for the development of the Chinese
economy and its broader society. On one side are the optimists, such as Robert Fogel,

whose recent work discusses the possibility of the Chinese economy reaching $123 trillion
in annual GDP by 2040, up from $4.9 trillion in 2009 (Fogel, 2010). On the other
side of the argument is, for example, Nicholas Eberstadt, who foresees profound negative
economic impacts of population aging, gender imbalances, reversal of the rural-tourban
migration flows, and the emergence of a new, unfamiliar family structure based
on the changing dependency ratios (Eberstadt, 2004).<br><br>
Fundamentally, the difference in these projections is based on the expectations
of a rapid paradigm shift in Chinese population. For example, Eberstadt’s “Perfect
Storm” scenario “posits very low fertility in 2040, extremely high sex ratios at birth,
a 30 percent decline in both urban and rural marriage rates, and a tripling of divorce
rates―and assumes sudden and imminent rather than gradual distant shifts in all
these tendencies” (Eberstadt, 2004, p. 17). By contrast, Fogel focuses on the effects of
a rapid increase in education, improved rural productivity, and an exceptional ability
of the Chinese state to implement population-enhancing policies.<br><br>
We believe that our focus on more near-term developments between 2020 and
2025 and on the most recent data available allows us to present a balance between these
more speculative alternatives. Though demographic changes will certainly pose considerable
challenges and provide significant opportunities to both nations in this period,
we do not expect those to be of either catastrophic or euphoric nature. While complex
systems, such as human populations, are occasionally prone to rapid changes in behavior,
often precipitated by unexpected phenomena, such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it
is important to keep in mind that the entirety of the workforce and the elderly of the
2020C2025 period have already been born; the largest uncertainty concerns the size of
the youth population and the resultant socioeconomic impact of changes in the youth
dependency ratio.<br><br>
Summary Assessment of the Relative Strengths and Weaknesses<br><br>
Brought About by Demographic Trends in China and India<br><br>
It is projected that China’s population will remain larger than India’s during most of
the 2020C2025 assessment period, but that India will surpass China in population size
in 2025. China is likely to continue to have higher GDP per capita than India,14 which
matters more on the world stage than numbers of people. In both countries, increasing
populations, together with increasing income and affluence, will increase demands
on world resources and place strains on the environment (World Bank, 2007; “India’s
Pollution Crisis,” 2008). China has since the mid-1970s had a larger percentage of its
population of working age than India; this difference is projected to persist through
our period of interest, 2020C2025, until 2030. However, the percentage of China’s

population that is of working age will peak in the next two years and decline thereafter,
while this percentage will be increasing in India. Because more women participate in
the labor force in China than in India, the crossover point for the proportion of women
that actually works may occur somewhat later.<br><br>
The opportunity to reap a “demographic dividend” is limited in time. Eventually,
the working-age population decreases in relative size, as its retiring members are
replaced by smaller cohorts resulting from lower fertility rates. While China has two
decades before its overall dependency ratio is projected to exceed India’s, it has only one
more year before the population of older people starts increasing more rapidly.
When compared with India, in the short term China seems to have more of the
preconditions to take advantage of its demographic window of opportunity and to deal
with demographics when they become a potential drag: more flexible labor markets;
higher rates of female labor force participation, more highly educated women, and
more open attitudes about women working; less illiteracy in general (and especially
for women); better infrastructure; more internal migration (though much of it “illegal”);
and a higher degree of urbanization, more openness to foreign trade, and slightly
higher rates of coverage by public pensions. It is for these reasons that we feel that, on
balance, China will remain “ahead” of India during the 2020C2025 assessment period.
In the long term, however, China’s prospects may be hindered by its demographics.
An aging population without an established safety net will create demands for new
types of services (particularly health care), reducing the disposable income of the working
population through wealth transfers to the elderly and laying claim to the large
national savings pool that China has built up during the boom years.<br><br>
It is our assessment that, on the whole, China’s projected demographics are creating
a challenge for its economic development―a potential demographic drag―that
may be more complex to manage compared with the situation of India. While China
was very successful in controlling the size of its population through antinatalist policies
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it is unclear whether it can successfully implement
pronatalist policies to avoid a long-term decrease in its population. Not only has
the social environment changed, but the goals of these policies are more difficult to
achieve―both democratic and authoritarian regimes in Europe found that such policies
mostly result in changing in the timing of childbearing rather than the overall
number of children (Hugo, 2000; David, 1982; Grant et al., 2004). Furthermore, even
if pronatalist policies are successful, it takes around two decades for the babies they
produce to become old enough to enter the labor force; in the meantime, the result
is an increase in the number of young dependents. India is perhaps facing a more
straightforward task, since its primary challenges are improving infrastructure, health
care, education, and the role of women rather than altering the behavior of individuals.
However, China has a good head start on development and, given its centralized
decisionmaking governance structure, will have an easier time implementing socioeconomic policies required for change, but the methods by which it could successfully
increase fertility are not obvious.<br><br>
In the future, India will have more favorable demographics than China, but
whether it is able to reap a demographic dividend will depend on successful government
implementation of an ambitious economic development agenda. Improving infrastructure,
health, education, and the role of women while maintaining social peace in
a society that is increasingly stratifying by income requires national consensus with a
long-term outlook. Whether such a course is possible in a large, diverse parliamentary
democracy such as India is difficult to predict. China’s experiences indicate that such
policies are feasible, but direct comparison between the two remains difficult.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">Chapter Three China-India: A Macroeconomic Assessment</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Introduction: Forecasts of Economic Growth in China and India
Economic growth in China and India has become a particular focus of attention in
Asia, in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, in the G-20, and in
the global economy. In recent decades, growth in both countries has exceeded expectations.
Between 1980 and 2008, China recorded an average annual growth in GDP
of 9 percent, while India’s growth during the same period was about 6 percent. Both
countries face the challenge of sustaining such high rates of growth. This chapter
summarizes a meta-analysis of growth estimates for China and India for the period
through 2025 by three sources: academic scholars, business organizations, and international
financial institutions. We also summarize and evaluate the key assumptions
underlying the estimates. Finally, we compare five different scenarios of high, low, and
average estimates between the two countries, and conclude with several observations
based on the meta-analysis.<br><br>
We conducted a meta-analysis of 27 studies made between 2000 and 2008 of
China’s and India’s recent and prospective levels and growth rates of GDP, capital,
employment, and total factor productivity. The studies used in the meta-analysis were
culled from a larger set of 47 based on the sufficiency of their data for conducting the
analysis. Most of the studies contained explicit projections of these macroeconomic
indicators through 2025. Where estimates of the two countries’ macroeconomic indicators
were implicit, we derived their implicit values using either an incremental capitaloutput
ratio method or a Cobb-Douglas production function. We detail the steps of
this meta-analysis in Appendix A.<br><br>
The analytic methods used in the 27 documents vary widely. Some rely on simple
extrapolation and trend analysis in forecasting growth of GDP and its components,
while other studies used more sophisticated models. Some analyses concentrate on a
single aspect of economic growth―for example, the role of capital accumulation and
its determinants in explaining differences between the two economies―while other
studies consider several factors and policies affecting growth in the two countries. Similarly,
some projections go only through 2020, while others extend through 2050. A
few of the studies focus on either China or India rather than on a comparative analysis


of both countries. In these few cases, we compare their respective results, while allowing
and adjusting for the studies’ differing data sources and methods.<br><br>
Our review of forecasted GDP growth rates in China and India through 2025
suggests that the recent rapid growth of these countries may be sustainable in the
future, but at a somewhat slower pace. As shown in Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1, for the
entire set of studies, growth rates are projected, on average, to be 5.7 percent in China

same period, the average estimates for growth in the accumulated stock of capital are
6.1 percent for China and 6.9 percent for India; for growth in employment, the average
estimates are 0.4 percent for China and 1.6 percent for India; and for total factor
productivity, the average estimates are 3.4 percent for China and 2.1 percent for India.
These estimates of average rates are, unsurprisingly, accompanied by major uncertainties,
as suggested by the wide range between the highest and lowest growth estimates,
as well as their corresponding variances.1 In the 27 studies we selected, the estimates
for GDP growth rates for the 2020C2025 period range from 3.8 to 9.0 percent
for China and from 2.8 to 8.4 percent for India. For the growth rates in capital stock,
estimates range from 4.2 to 9.4 percent for China and from 3.9 to 9.8 percent for
India. For employment growth rates, the ranges are from C0.1 to 0.6 percent for China
and from 0.7 to 1.9 percent for India. And for total factor productivity, the estimated
growth rates range from 2.1 to 5.6 percent for China and from 0.1 to 3.6 percent for
India.2<br><br>
In the following section, we review these estimates by separating them into three
clusters: (a) those by academic authors and institutions, (b) those by business organizations
and authors (e.g., Goldman Sachs, PricewaterhouseCoopers, McKinsey), and
(c) those by international organizations (e.g., the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund). We also evaluate the differing assumptions that explain the wide range of
the estimates and highlight several other contrasting aspects of the three clusters.<br><br>
Studies by Academic Authors and Institutions<br><br>
We included 11 studies by academic authors and institutions in our set of 27 studies.3
The academic cluster of studies generates the widest range of growth estimates for both
China and India; the range of estimates for this cluster is summarized in Table 3.2.
Within this cluster, the highest estimate for China’s annual GDP growth for 2020C
2025 is 9 percent, and the lowest is 3.8 percent. For India, the estimates for annual
GDP growth within this cluster range from 2.8 percent to 7.2 percent. Again, the variances
of estimates in this group are higher than for the studies by business groups and
international organizations. That the variance in the academic authors’ estimates is by

far the largest among the three clusters is a finding that will be surprising to some readers,
but unsurprising to others!<br><br>
In making these estimates, the academic authors tend to focus especially on one
or two particular aspects of each country’s growth. For example, some studies in this
cluster focus especially on demographic changes in China and India (Golley and Tyers,
2006; Tyers et al., 2006). Another forecast in this cluster focuses especially on the
two countries’ roles in global energy markets, their greenhouse gas emissions, and
the resulting effects on growth (Paltsev and Reilly, 2007a). Still another study in this
cluster focuses heavily on China’s regional economic structure, basing its estimates on
sectoral and regional economic growth (Huang et al., 2003). Several studies base their
long-term forecasts on a standard Cobb-Douglas production function (Holz, 2005;
Poncet, 2006).<br><br>
Holz (2005), from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, projects
the highest annual GDP growth rate for China (9 percent) for the 2020C2025
period, arguing that China can expect many years of rapid economic growth. Holz’s
forecast mainly rests on projecting recent growth rates into the future; he concludes
that China’s GDP will surpass that of the United States in purchasing-power terms by
the middle of the next decade.4 He suggests this trajectory would follow the examples
of Japan, Taiwan, and Korea in the early stages of their development. Holz contends
that the structural changes taking place in China, along with factor price equalizations,
will match the patterns of growth achieved by these other countries.<br><br>

In sharp contrast, another author in this cluster (Laurent, 2006) suggests that
China’s average annual GDP growth rate in 2020C2025 will decline to 3.8 percent,
reasoning that declining numbers of prime working-age workers will inhibit China’s
growth. Laurent contends that India’s growing labor force might enable India to grow
more rapidly if its populous were more highly educated. However, unlike other economists
who compare the two economies, Laurent is pessimistic about India’s ability to
educate its population. He expresses little confidence that this will happen, and forecasts
that India’s average annual GDP growth in 2020C2025 will fall to 3.4 percent.
The effect of declining population on economic growth is also among the most
significant issues raised in the study by Tyers et al. (2006) from the Australian National
University (ANU). Their study suggests that relative labor abundance in India will
bring higher capital returns and attract a rising share of global foreign direct investment
to India.5 Accordingly, the Tyers et al. forecast for India’s annual growth rate in
2020C2025 is 7.2 percent. The authors believe that India will displace China as the
world’s most rapidly expanding economy.<br><br>
The ANU authors also examine the economic impact of a hypothetical increase
in fertility in China that might occur if (1) China were to abandon its one-child policy
and (2) a more-rapid-than-expected reduction of fertility were to occur in India. The
ANU authors question the plausibility of this scenario by noting that, even if China
were to abandon its one-child policy, fertility might not rise substantially; the authors
point to the reduction in fertility in China that occurred before introduction of the
one-child policy in 1979 (Carnell, 2000) to show that forces other than policy have
influenced China’s fertility rate. For example, fertility is sensitive to cultural norms as
well as economic incentives. Consequently, if a norm of low fertility has indeed taken
root in China, it may be difficult to reverse. In India, too, fertility has been falling
slowly, as discussed in Chapter Two. An acceleration of fertility reduction in India
might occur either as a consequence of economic development or because of exogenous
societal reasons.<br><br>
A contrasting study from scholars at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(Paltsev and Reilly, 2007b) forecasts that India’s average annual GDP growth rate in
2020C2025 may be as low as 2.8 percent, due especially to high energy prices which
would put a heavier burden on India’s increasing oil imports. However, the MIT paper
ignores the possible effects of new technologies that might partly reduce dependence
on fossil fuel imports as well as lower their prices.<br><br>
Similar to Holz (2005), researchers at CEPII, a French research center on international
economics (Poncet, 2006), use a production function based on a neoclassical
model in which GDP growth depends on growth of the labor force, growth of capital,
and growth of total factor productivity. Poncet’s GDP projections for both China and

India are modest, placing them at average annual rates of 4.6 and 4.5 percent, respectively,
during the period through 2025. Unlike other studies in the three clusters of
our meta-analysis, in which total factor productivity enters the growth forecasts exogenously
(Poddar and Yi, 2007; Hofman and Kujis, 2007; Rodrik and Subramanian,
2004), or in which it is modeled as a process of “catch-up” (Wilson and Purushothaman,
2003), Poncet’s study links the growth of factor productivity to investment
in human capital. Growth in total factor productivity becomes an endogenous function
of average years of education and the income gap compared with income in the
United States. The resulting differences in total factor productivity and in the growth
projections for India and China are thereby enlarged. Taking into account expected
improvements in education, Poncet projects the average annual total factor productivity
growth in the period 2020C2025 in China as 2.5 percent and in India as 1.9 percent.<br><br>

In particular, Poncet projects that China and India’s GDPs could grow at yearly
average rates of 4.6 and 4.5 percent, respectively, during a period running up to 2025.
One paper in the academic cluster (Hofman and Kuijs, 2007) estimates an average
annual GDP growth rate for China of 6.7 percent during the 2020C2025 period,
while suggesting that China’s recent 9 percent growth rate is likely to be unsustainable.<br><br>
The authors believe that the greatest threat to China’s future growth lies in the
internal imbalance between aggregate domestic savings and domestic investment that
has developed since 2005. They estimate that China’s aggregate national savings have
come to exceed aggregate domestic investment by 12 percent of GDP. Some researchers
have paid less attention to this imbalance, focusing instead on the external imbalances
reflected in China’s large and continuing current account surpluses―in fact, the two
sets of imbalances are exactly equal to one another, because of the basic accounting
identity that defines how the external and internal flow of funds is calculated.6
According to Hofman and Kuijs, China’s aggregate surplus of savings is due largely
to rapid increases in enterprise saving, whereas household and government saving has
been stable or declining in recent years (Hofman and Kuijs, 2007).7 China’s corporate
sector has been enjoying high profits, while the wage share of GDP has been declining.
The authors argue that this disparity is at the heart of China’s growing income inequality,
and they suggest this is further exacerbated by the low returns earned by China’s
savers in financial markets (about 2.5 percent), despite the economy’s rapid growth.<br><br>

Studies by Business Organizations and Authors<br><br>
We included nine studies by business organizations and authors in our set of 27 studies.
8 Table 3.3 summarizes the range of GDP growth estimates generated by this cluster.
The studies in the business cluster are typically rooted in the neoclassical growth model
referred to above, and they generate a relatively narrow range of annual GDP growth
estimates for China in the period from 2020 to 2025: between 4.5 and 5.2 percent. In
contrast, the range of growth estimates for India is considerably wider: between 5.4
and 8.4 percent. The 8.4 percent estimate is from a Goldman Sachs paper (Wilson and
Purushothaman, 2003) that optimistically posits high productivity growth, generally
favorable demographic factors, and improvements in educational attainment.<br><br>
Contrary to the average growth estimates of the academic cluster, the business
cluster studies place India’s expected GDP growth rates in the 2020C2025 period above
China’s―specifically, an average estimate of GDP growth of 6.3 percent for India
versus 4.7 percent for China. These figures compare with the academic cluster’s average
estimate of 5.4 percent for China and 4.3 percent for India. Furthermore, the variance
estimates for the business cluster are substantially lower than for the academic cluster.
Not surprisingly, the papers in the business cluster, especially those sponsored by
Goldman Sachs, accord particular importance to the prevailing regulatory environment
and the protection of property rights in influencing their growth forecasts. This
emphasis is missing in the papers by the academic institutions discussed earlier, and in
the international organizations’ studies.<br><br>

The studies sponsored by the business organizations also tend to compare their
estimates for China and India with those of other Asian economies, in particular South
Korea―a characteristic that the business cluster shares with the cluster of studies by
international financial institutions.<br><br>
One of the business organization papers, from Goldman Sachs (Wilson and
Purushothaman, 2003), suggests that, if certain conditions prevail in China―namely,
macroeconomic stability, high investment rates, and a large labor force―the result
will likely make China the world’s largest economy by 2041, when China’s per capita
income is estimated to be US$30,000.9 According to this study, India’s growth rate is
likely to remain above 5 percent for several decades, and its GDP will exceed Japan’s
by 2032, reaching a level of per capita income 35 times its current level yet still significantly
lower than China’s in 2050.<br><br>
Wilson and Purushothaman make several simplifying assumptions that indeed
cast doubt on their final estimates. For example, they do not consider changing demographic
conditions in China, instead making the erroneous assumption that the
proportion of the working-age population in China will remain stable. In reality, as
discussed in Chapter Two, the percentage of China’s working age population is
expected to peak in 2010C2012 and to decline thereafter. Furthermore, Wilson and
Purushothaman make an unrealistic assumption that the investment rate of economies
seeking to catch up with the developed countries will remain very high and constant. It
is more realistic to assume that, as India and China’s per capita income levels approach
those of the developed countries, they will experience lower rates of return on investment,
and therefore lower their rates of investment, leading to lower rates of growth
in total factor productivity. These reduced rates will tend to converge more closely
to those prevailing in more advanced economies. For example, developing countries
that previously maintained an investment rate of 25C30 percent of GDP are likely to
find these rates converging toward prevailing levels in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (about 20 percent) (World Bank,
undated), as a result of lower rates of return on new investment.<br><br>

One of the more pessimistic Goldman Sachs papers (Purushothaman, 2004)
places India’s annual GDP growth at about 5.7 percent during the 2020C2025 period,
reasoning that the two crucial conditions of improved infrastructure and expanded
education may be insufficient to keep India on a steady growth path. Another Goldman
Sachs paper (Poddar and Yi, 2007) calls attention to certain constraints on doing
business in India as potential threats to private enterprise.10<br><br>
Another paper sponsored by the Deutsche Bank (Bergheim, 2005) projects India
to grow more rapidly than China in the period to 2020. The Bergheim paper forecasts
India’s average annual GDP growth at 5.5 percent, compared with projected Chinese
GDP growth of 5.2 percent over the same period. The major contributor to this gap,
according to Bergheim, is China’s slower population growth rate (at 0.8 percent annually,
about half that of India’s growth rate), an outcome of its one-child policy.
Analysts from the McKinsey Global Institute (2006) suggest that India’s likely
continuation of its recent rapid growth will result in the tripling of India’s average
household income over the next two decades. If this trend is sustained, India will
become the world’s fifth-largest consumer economy by 2025, compared with its current
position of 12th. Unlike other studies in the business organization cluster, and
while noting the progress that India has made to date, the McKinsey paper emphasizes
the significant challenges it still faces. These include, for example, the large regional
disparities in growth and in poverty levels: For example, India’s southern and western
states prosper while the northern and eastern states lag far behind. Furthermore, while
India has been slowly urbanizing over the past two decades, the McKinsey study sugto analysts from the McKinsey Global Institute, only 29 percent of the Indian population
currently lives in cities, compared with 40 percent in China and 48 percent in
Indonesia. The McKinsey analysts project that the level of urbanization will increase to
only 37 percent by 2025 in India. Finally, they note that while more Indians are completing
secondary and higher education, India’s educational system remains severely
strained and that opportunities for schooling vary widely, as does the quality of schooling.
Indeed, nearly all of the business group authors stress educational inequality in
India as a significant impediment and a relative disadvantage in comparison with the
educational condition in China.11<br><br>

Studies by International Organizations<br><br>
We included seven studies by international organizations in the set of 27 studies.12
Table 3.4 summarizes the international organizations’ GDP growth estimates for China

and India in the 2020C2025 period. This cluster of studies projects higher growth estimates
than those made by the business cluster, but similar estimates to those in the
academic cluster. Whereas the business cluster’s range of growth estimates is wider for
India than for China, the international organization cluster shows a wider range in the
estimates for China than for India. The variance of the estimates for China is larger for
the international organization cluster than for the business cluster, although still lower
than for the academic cluster.<br><br>
An anthology published by the World Bank (Winters and Yusef, 2007) provides
several analytic models for assessing developments in the Chinese and Indian economies
and their impact on global markets through 2020. In addition to providing forecasts
of the two countries’ economic growth, this book analyzes what would occur if
China were to grow at an annual average rate of 6.6 percent, and India at 5.5 percent,
through 2020. Several essays explore other facets of China and India’s growth, including
effects on the geographical location of global industry, changes in the international
financial system, effects on the global environment, and the relationship between
growth and governments.<br><br>
A paper from the International Monetary Fund (Rodrik and Subramanian,
2004) estimates India’s annual GDP growth during the 2020C2025 period using a
growth-accounting model based on inputs of capital and labor and increases in factor
productivity. Rodrik and Subramanian acknowledge that their estimates may be low
if India succeeds in expanding and improving its educational system. They note that
India’s productivity growth has benefited from its stock of highly educated people,
although they do not provide much supporting evidence. They also acknowledge that
their growth forecasts rely on continuation of effective economic and social reforms
in India. Rodrik and Subramanian also contend that, unlike China, India already has
strong economic and political institutions, so that further reform need not be burdensome.
Instead, they suggest that India “has done the really hard work of building good
economic and political institutions―a stable democratic polity, reasonable rule of law,
and protection of property rights,” concluding that “countries with good institutions
do not in general experience large declines in growth.”<br><br>
As previously noted, not all of the authors and clusters of studies agree with this
judgment. Some of the other studies contend, instead, that the effectiveness of India’s
institutions leaves much to be desired (e.g., Poddar and Yi, 2007).<br><br>
Similarities and Differences Among the Clusters<br><br>
As indicated in Table 3.1 and the preceding sections, forecasts of the absolute and
relative macroeconomic performance of India and China in the 2020C2025 period
betoken deep uncertainty. Estimates of both China and India’s annual economic
growth over this period vary by a factor greater than two (3.8C9 percent for China and


2.8C8.4 percent for India) across the 27 studies in our meta-analysis. The range in forecasts
for the United States and most OECD countries would be less than half as large.<br><br>
Table 3.5 and Figure 3.2 summarize how the three clusters of studies differ from
each other. For example, the widest variation in growth estimates for both China and
India comes from the academic cluster. Table 3.5 also shows that the estimates of
growth rates emanating from scholars at international organizations tend to be the
highest among the three clusters, while the estimates from the business cluster show
the widest difference in the growth estimates between India and China. Furthermore,
the business cluster projected distinctively higher growth estimates for India than for
China.<br><br>

The contrasting forecasts of the three clusters are portrayed visually in Figure 3.3.
In the figure, India’s annual growth is indicated along the y-axis, and China’s on the
x-axis. The three rectangles show the distribution of the summary statistics for, respectively,
the business cluster (in orange), the academic cluster (in blue), and the international
cluster (in lavender). The means for each cluster are indicated by the correspondingly
colored dots in each rectangle. The lowest growth estimates for India and China
for each cluster appear at the lower left (or southwest corner) of each rectangle, and the
highest growth estimates appear at the upper-right (northeast) corner of each rectangle.
The x’s shown in Figure 3.3 represent, from top right to lower left, the high, average,
and low China-India growth estimates for the pooled set of all 27 studies included in
the meta-analysis.13<br><br>
Interpreting, let alone explaining, the notable differences among the three clusters
is bound to be conjectural. For example, the widest variances characterizing the
academic cluster’s estimates might plausibly be attributed to greater awareness by the
scholarly community of the enormous sources of uncertainty affecting economic forecasts
a decade-and-a-half into the future. Perhaps another influence contributing to

this spread may lie in differences in worldviews―that is, a division among academic
economists between those who are professionally inclined to favor central planning
and an expanded role of government in economic development, and those who are
inclined to favor greater reliance on free markets, market-based pricing, and decentralized
innovation in determining resource allocation. Those on the former side may tend
to see a rosier outlook for China, while those on the latter side may be inclined to view
India’s prospects more favorably. The result of these differing dispositions and behaviors
may be the widened variance of their respective forecasts.<br><br>
By similar reasoning, it may be presumed that studies of economic growth sponsored
by business organizations might tend to be led by economists inclined toward
market-based development. Hence, such studies are probably more likely to view
India’s democracy, rule of law, and legally protected property rights as constituting a
more propitious environment for business innovation and long-term economic growth
than that provided by China’s one-party autocracy. Consequently, it is not surprising
that the highest growth estimates for India relative to China come from the businesssponsored
studies included in the meta-analysis.<br><br>
Finally, that the forecasts made by the international organizations’ studies show
a marked advantage in China’s expected growth relative to India’s may plausibly be
attributed to China’s more prominent role in international trade and investment markets
relative to India. As a consequence, one might expect international organizations
to be particularly cognizant of and sensitive to this in their estimates of the two economies’
growth over the next 15 years, resulting in the relatively buoyant forecasts for
China. Underlying and contributing to the wide differences in forecasts are significant
differences in the assumptions made by the forecasters. For example, some of the forecasts
simply assume a continuation of recent growth trends in both countries, extrapolating
linearly to forecast the 2020C2025 period. Other forecasts focus especially on
demographic trends and especially trends in labor supplies that inhere in the current
circumstances of the two countries’ population cohorts and fertility rates. Still other
forecasts build their estimating models on assumptions relating to energy prices and
the heavy dependence of the two countries on fossil fuel imports. Further, some of
the forecasts make assumptions about the prevalence of macroeconomic stability, economic
openness, the quality or inequality of educational opportunities, and the integrity
of economic and social institutions. Embedded in most of the studies that use the
neoclassical model described earlier are simplifying and arguable assumptions about
constant returns to scale and competitive markets.<br><br>
In turn, these assumptions and the selectivity of their focus affect the inputs to
the analytic models that the authors use in generating their respective forecasts. In the
process, the forecasts ignore cyclical fluctuations around long-term trend estimates.
They ignore the possibility of such major adverse shocks as political disturbances, natural
disasters, or military conflict and, on the optimistic side of the spectrum, the possibility of a major technological jump that might trigger a new wave of innovation in
either China or India.<br><br>
Always, implicit, and sometimes explicit, in the respective forecasts is a recognition
by the authors that China and India have taken quite different paths in pursuit of
their economic development. China has emphasized the expansion of labor-intensive
manufacturing, while India has charted a path from agriculture to high-end services
with a limited increase in the manufacturing sector. In sum, the wide range of the estimates
reflects both the assumptions and behavioral dispositions of the forecasters, the
issues they focus on as well as those they ignore, and the deep uncertainties that surround
forecasts over the next decade-and-a-half.<br><br>
Five Growth Scenarios and Concluding Observations
The meta-analysis discussed in the preceding sections displays quantitatively the profound
uncertainties that pervade attempts to forecast how two such dynamic and complex
systems as the economies of India and China will fare over the next 15 years. This
uncertainty pervades the 27 studies encompassed in our analysis, whether they are
examined in the aggregate or within the three separate clusters of the academic, business,
and international organization studies.<br><br>
In this section, we contrast five scenarios consisting of different pairings of the
forecasts for the two countries: a scenario in which both countries grow at their respective
average estimates, and scenarios that show the four combinations of the separate
high and low growth estimates for China and India. On the implicit but plausible
premise that many of the major factors affecting the economic performance of China
and India (e.g., their respective fiscal and monetary policies, education policies, business
regulatory policies, etc.) are uncorrelated with one another, these starkly contrasting
high-low scenarios can serve two purposes: first, to highlight (and in some sense
magnify) the uncertainties that emerge from the meta-analysis, and second, to provide
a basis for contingency planning for policymakers. More specifically, the challenges
that U.S. policymakers face will be very different depending on which of the contrasting
scenarios ensues. That said, it should also be noted that the most appropriate policy
responses to the contrasting scenarios are more likely to involve adjusting to them,
rather than shaping them. We do not mean to suggest, for example, that U.S. policy
is without some influence on which scenario occurs, but rather that the extent of such
influence, as well as of the resources that the United States is likely to be willing to
deploy to affect scenario outcomes, affects the scenarios only at their margins rather
than their defining cores.<br><br>
Figure 3.4 shows the five contrasting GDP growth pairings between China and
India in 2020C2025 under the five contrasting scenarios.<br><br>

Figures 3.5 and 3.6 show the GDPs for India and China in 2025 in terms of
market exchange rates (Figure 3.5) and PPP conversion rates (Figure 3.6).
As Figures 3.5 and 3.6 indicate, only in the scenario in which high growth in
India is paired with low China growth does India’s GDP approach China’s. In the four
other scenarios, China’s predominance is decisive. This outcome is the same whether
conversions are calculated with market exchange rates or PPP rates.
Turning to a more qualitative aspect of the China-India assessment, Table 3.6
distills from the meta-analysis our judgment about the advantages and disadvantages
of China and India in their respective institutional and other circumstances.
Whether and to what extent the factors listed in the preceding table will enable
India to move closer to, or ahead of, China after 2025 is worthy of separate consideration.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">CHAPTER FOUR Science and Technology</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Introduction<br><br>
Scientific research, invention, and innovation are key drivers of economic growth.
During the past three decades, R&D investment in the world economy has been concentrated
in 30 countries, all of which are members of the OECD (National Science
Foundation, 2007a). Nevertheless, global R&D structures and innovation are undergoing
transition, and there is strong evidence that patterns of research and innovation
are changing (OECD, 2008a).<br><br>
The main dimensions of this change are (1) the absolute growth in total R&D
activity, (2) the rise of particular emerging market economies―especially China and
India―in terms of not only their economic size, but also the intensity of their science
and technology efforts, and (3) use of a growing diversity of policy instruments to
foster innovation (OECD, 2007a).<br><br>
Non-OECD countries account for a growing share of global R&D investment:
18.4 percent in 2005, compared with 11.7 percent in 1996 (OECD, 2008a). Meanwhile,
the U.S. and EU shares in global R&D have decreased by 3 percent and 2 percent,
respectively. Other R&D indicators, such as publications, also reflect a similar
reallocation of R&D effort. OECD countries have retained their dominance in science
and engineering (S&E), producing 85 percent of S&E publications from 1993
to 2002―but two-thirds of the remainder were generated by China, India, Brazil,
Russia, and South Africa. The growth in S&E publications from these five non-OECD
countries has been much more rapid than that of the rest (NSF, 2007a).<br><br>
Innovation and investment depend on more than simply spending more money.<br><br>
They also benefit from development of a sound legal environment to protect intellectual
property, investment in higher education to increase the supply of highly skilled
human resources, and a favorable and predictable regulatory environment that contributes
to the incentives for as well as protection of intellectual property.<br><br>
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of S&T infrastructure
and performance indicators for China and India, as well as forecasts for these indicators
through 2025. Our forecast methodology is based on an “accounting model” that
uses estimates of each country’s GDP and its growth as exogenous variables; these

estimates are derived from the meta-analysis in Chapter Three. The model is linear,
with constant returns to scale and with slopes estimated from current data. Thus, the
model can be used to generate simple and clean quantitative estimates, although serious
questions can be raised about whether the model’s assumptions exclude important
aspects of the dynamic processes that are involved by tying our estimates too closely
to GDP growth. Our forecasts are presented in U.S. dollars converted from rupees
and renminbi using PPP conversion rates. The outlays in local currencies could also be
converted using market exchange rates, as was done in Figure 3.5 in Chapter Three.<br><br>
In the next section, we highlight several global trends in S&T and how they are
influencing China and India. The global trend indicators that we use include R&D
spending, human resources, and patents, especially triadic patents (those that are filed
in the U.S., EU, and Japanese markets).<br><br>
Highlights and Global Trends<br><br>
In this section, we highlight several major trends affecting R&D globally in general
and in China and India in particular. Technology policies are difficult to measure.
Thus, analysis and comparisons have to rely on a set of indicators to approximate different
phases of these policies. There are two types of indicators: input and output.
Input indicators include financial and human resources in R&D activities. Investment
in R&D―usually called R&D intensity―is approximated by gross expenditures
in R&D (GERD) as a percentage of GDP. GERD is usually decomposed into
four performing sectors: business (BERD), government (GOVERD), higher education
(HERD), and private nonprofit (PNPERD). Human resources include researchers and
personnel involved in research activities. To ensure comparability, human resources
are measured on a full-time equivalent scale. Researchers include people with a Ph.D.
in S&E.<br><br>
Clearly, the contributions of R&D to the society are the ultimate measure of
R&D’s output. As proxy indicators of R&D output, we use the number of patents and
publications produced by each country’s researchers.<br><br>
Global Trends<br><br>
Studies of the sources of macroeconomic growth highlight the relevance of information
technology (IT) and its contribution to multifactor productivity (OECD, 2008a,
p. 20). OECD (2008a) reports that the widening disparities in growth trends over the
past few decades are largely due to the size of the information and communication
technology (ICT) industries and the pace of IT adoption by other industries. Countries’
ability to produce and incorporate innovation will determine their future economic
growth.<br><br>

Financial Indicators. Gross domestic expenditure in R&D (GERD) as a percentage
of GDP―also known as research intensity―has been increasing in real terms at a
3.2 percent average rate worldwide for the past three decades (OECD, 2008a). But, as
a consequence of the financial crisis, GERD is forecasted to slow down. For instance,
in the United States the rate of growth slowed to 1.3 percent in 2008.
Table 4.1 shows GERD and its four components as a percentage of GDP for select
countries for the 1995C2005 period. Figure 4.1 highlights the preponderant share of
India’s R&D spending represented by government.<br><br>
Business R&D (BERD) is the major component of GERD in industrialized<br><br>
countries (OECD, 2008a, p. 11). Although it was the main driver of GERD in the
1990s, BERD has diminished since the beginning of the 21st century, with the hightech
recession in early 2000 and thereafter. BERD is higher in Japan, South Korea,
and the United States than it is in the European Union (EU). U.S. BERD is nearly
2 percent of GDP, while in the EU it is only half of this intensity, well short of the
Lisbon Strategy’s BERD target of 2 percent of GDP.1<br><br>
BERD is related to the composition of industry, because some business sectors
are more R&D-intensive than others. BERD is also related to the presence and relative

shares of large firms, which tend to invest more in R&D than do small ones. Business
R&D intensity has grown in most Asian countries. China’s BERD is currently half as
large as that of the EU due to China’s increase in business investments in the past three
decades.<br><br>
Public investment in R&D has two components: intramural spending and higher
education funding. Most EU countries have increased the government-financed component
(GOVERD) of R&D activities, with the objective of increasing GERD to
3 percent of GDP by 2010, consistent with the Lisbon Strategy. GOVERD averages
0.65 percent in the OECD area, with an overall decreasing trend that reflects, in part,
a shift from direct to indirect support of R&D in the business sector (OECD, 2008a).
HERD intensity varies in accord with the fields in which higher education spending
is concentrated. For example, 85 percent of Taiwan’s HERD spending is on engineering
and mathematics, whereas Taiwan’s spending on social sciences is almost negligible
(IECD, 2008a).<br><br>
When GERD is broken down by domestic versus international funding, international
sources clearly emerge as a sizable component. This is due to the increasing
internationalization of R&D activities. Overall, R&D funding from abroad (through
private businesses, public institutions, or international organizations) has increased
steadily in the past 15 years. External funding as a percentage of GERD ranges from
11 percent to 26 percent and has increased sharply since the mid-1990s. This internationalization
mirrors the increased collaboration between countries, which has in turn

led to increases in co-invention on patents and co-authorship of scientific publications
(OECD, 2008a, p. 30).<br><br>
Human Resources. The availability of skilled human resources in S&T is a measure
of a country’s ability to innovate, sustain, and create high-technology jobs. Highly
skilled people create and diffuse innovation and are as important as capital inputs.
Overall, human resources for science and technology (HRST) has increased more rapidly
than total employment in the past few decades (Figure 4.2). This trend fits well
with the increasing demand for highly qualified workers for all sectors of the economies
and not just for research-related activities in particular. India’s decrease in HRST
during the past decade is a puzzling anomaly that may be due to changes in the way
HRST is measured in India.<br><br>
The S&E degrees of people employed in engineering, manufacturing and construction,
life sciences, physical sciences, agriculture, mathematics, and computing as
a proportion of the total degrees are a loose indicator of the potential contribution to
technology innovations in S&T. As Figure 4.3 shows, this percentage varies across
countries, with Taiwan heavily concentrated in S&E diplomas (more than 80 percent
of total doctorates), and the EU being the region with the lowest proportion in the
sample. The remainder of the sample has around 40 to 50 percent of their graduates
in the innovation-related fields. The low percentage of S&E graduates is a concern for





many countries, according to OECD (2008a), and many of them have implemented
policies to increase human resources in science and technology (OECD, 2008a, p. 98).
Scientific Production. R&D output is generally reflected in two types of indicators:
patents (applied research) and published journal articles (basic R&D). Countries
that spend more on R&D (such as the United States, Japan, Germany, and France)
have higher propensity to patent (OECD, 2008a; Bernardes et al., 2006).<br><br>
Publications. The numbers of articles published provide information about the
size and the focus of research activity. Worldwide number of publications has been
increasing especially in the countries that have low initial levels. Figure 4.4 shows that
while the United States has remained stable in number of publications since 1995,
most Asian countries have dramatically increased the total number of articles published
and counted by Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge (formerly the Institute for
Scientific Information [ISI]), from 51,000 in 1988 to 135,000 in 2003 (NSF, 2007b,
p. 21). China has quadrupled its S&E publications in a decade in 2003 and, as a result,
China’s share in Asia has grown from 11 percent to 22 percent, the same level as Japan’s.
India is recovering since 2001 after a long stagnation period (NSF, 2007a, p. 1).
With respect to national strategies, there is no single or unique “mode” of innovation.<br><br>
Even if common innovation patterns have been identified, there are major
national differences in patterns of competitive and comparative advantage. Innovations in firms include not only technological innovation and generation of technology
but also nontechnological innovations, such as advanced management techniques (for
example, total quality management). Policies to foster innovation should extend to all
sources of innovation that may boost productivity growth.<br><br>
Patents. Patents indicate a country’s innovative capacity, but they are an imperfect
measure because of the differences in national patent laws and the fact that some
innovations are not patentable. For this reason, the analysis of patenting tends to focus
on patent filings in the United States, since the United States tends to attract innovations
from around the world. Half of the patents issued in the United States were filed
for foreign residents. Nevertheless, this is still an imperfect measure, in part because
countries may differ systematically in their propensities to apply for U.S. patents
depending on the extent of their commercial ties.2 In the analysis presented here, we
examine triadic patents: patents that are filed at the European Patent Office (EPO),
the USPTO, and the Japan Patent Office (JPO) for the same invention, by the same
applicant or inventor.<br><br>
Filing for patents in three different markets (United States, EU, and Japan) is
costly in terms of paperwork, time, and money but gives access to the most lucrative
markets. For this reason, a triadic patent is a good proxy for the patent’s economic
value. Figure 4.5 demonstrates that Asian economies increased their share in
triadic patent families; South Korea, Japan and China were the countries that led
the growth. Asian countries’ global share of triadic patents increased between 1995
and 2005. During this period, South Korea’s share increased by 5 percentage points,
Japan’s increased by 2, and China’s increased by 0.7 (OECD 2008a, p. 43). Although
India has had some increase since the 1990s, its contribution to the world total is still
modest (OECD, 2008a, p. 43).<br><br>
China<br><br>
China is the third-largest R&D spender worldwide after the United States and Japan,
with an annual GERD growth rate of 18 percent since 2000 (OECD, 2007b, p. 14).
China’s BERD has increased from 0.25 percent of GDP in 1996 to around
1.01 percent in 2006. This increase reflects, in part, the restructuring of formerly
state-owned enterprises and is consistent with China’s decrease in GOVERD. China’s
annual HERD growth rate (9C10 percent) is ranked second in the world since 2001
(OECD, 2008a, p. 29).<br><br>

In its 11th Plan, China has set the following goals, to be accomplished by 2020:<br><br>
 raise GERD to at least 2.5 percent of GDP<br><br>
 raise total factor productivity (TFP) to 60 percent of GDP growth<br><br>
 number of Chinese invention patents to rank in the world’s top five<br><br>
 number of internationally cited Chinese articles to rank in the world’s top five.<br><br>
India<br><br>
India’s GERD is around 0.8 percent of GNP, compared with more than 2 percent in
the developed countries (Ministry of Science and Technology, Department of Science
and Technology, Government of India, no date).<br><br>
Breaking down the components of India’s GERD, 70.5 percent is GOVERD 
(62 percent central and 8.5 percent state government), 4.2 percent is HERD, and
25.3 percent is BERD (5.0 percent from public-sector industries and 20.3 percent from
private-sector industries) (Ministry of Science and Technology, Department of Science
and Technology, Government of India, no date). India’s 11th five-year plan, covering
2008 to 2013, calls for India to triple its investment in S&T to 2.5 percent of GDP
(Table 4.2).<br><br>


Quality and Comparability of S&E Diplomas and the Skilled Diaspora
China graduates 600,000 engineers per year, and India 350,000;3 by comparison, the
United States graduates roughly 70,000 undergraduate engineers annually.4 In November
2005, the United States called for increasing this figure to 100,000.5 Evidence
from executives doing business in India and China indicates that both countries still
have shortages despite the number of graduates (McKinsey Global Institute, 2005).
Part of the problem is the quality of the statistics. While American graduation statistics
are accurate, Chinese and Indian statistics are quite fragmented and imperfectly
comparable.<br><br>
Quality of Engineers Compared<br><br>
The meaning of the word engineer varies by country. In China, the word does not
translate well into different dialects and has no standard definition (Wadhwa et al.,
2007): “A motor mechanic or a technician could be considered an engineer, for example.”
Wadhwa et al. (2007) provide several examples of how Chinese statistics count
any degree related to information technology as an engineering degree, including “any
bachelor’s degree with ‘engineering’ in its title,” and regardless of the number of years
needed to obtain the degree.<br><br>
The increase in engineering graduation rates in China was originated by the Chinese
government’s initiatives, starting in 1999, to transform science and engineering
education into mass education. Higher enrollments in schools, reductions in teacher
salaries, and reductions in the number of technical schools and teachers led to dramatic
increases in class sizes and deterioration in the quality of education provided by Chinese schools.6 Reportedly, multinational firms operating in China feel comfortable
about hiring graduates from only 10 to 15 of its universities. According to China’s
National Development and Reform Commission, 60 percent of university graduates
in 2006 were not able to find work. As a consequence, the Chinese Ministry of
Education announced in June 2006 that it would begin to reduce enrollments.7 This
announcement was part of more comprehensive reforms in tertiary education intended
to increase productivity in teaching and research; academic personnel will also be
recruited through open advertisements and on a merit basis, while a system of performance
management will be introduced in higher education institutions (Gallagher
et al., 2009, p. 6)<br><br>
India offers a very different scenario. Engineering education in India has been
market-driven and characterized by few regulatory bodies and an inefficient and heavily
politicized public education system. Ongoing debates in the country focus on the
demand for caste-based quotas for more than half of the available seats in public institutions.
Due to the inefficiencies in the public sector, national innovation is based on
the private educational institutions. In 2004, India had 974 private engineering colleges
and only 291 public institutions. Moreover, private training centers across the
country have flourished and serve corporations that need to train employees (and job
seekers). Among the public universities, quality varies widely; some centers, such as
the Indian Institutes of Technology, provide high-quality education, but they graduate
only a small percentage of India’s engineers.<br><br>
Despite the heterogeneity in quality, multinational executives feel more comfortable
about hiring Indian engineering graduates. A 2005 survey from the McKinsey
Global Institute (2005) of 83 globally based multinationals reports that 80.7 percent
of U.S. engineers were employable, whereas only 10 percent of Chinese engineers and
25 percent of Indian engineers were similarly employable (Gereffi et al., 2008, p. 21).
The main reasons for the low employability figures for China’s and India’s engineers
were that the engineers’ background included little or no hands-on experience despite
solid theoretical training, poor English-language ability, and overall communication
and cultural style (McKinsey Global Institute, 2005). These employability numbers
have direct bearing on competitiveness in global labor markets. We refrain from
making an adjustment of this sort in our model because we assume that quality will
improve in the future. However, later in this chapter we present an exercise that allows
for such a “quality” adjustment.<br><br>

Graduate and Postgraduate Engineering<br><br>
Based on on-site interviews, Wadhwa et al. (2007) report that the business executives
preferred to hire graduates with master’s or Ph.D. degrees, though they did not mandate
Ph.D. degrees for research positions. Getting either a master’s or Ph.D. degree is
easier for Chinese executives than for Indian executives. For the United States, on the
other hand, the problem is the shortage of native students completing master’s and
Ph.D. degrees. This could become even more systemic, especially as both countries’
economic growth improves and they become more competitive in terms of salary and
opportunities for career development.8,9<br><br>
Emerging Models of Diaspora Mobilization<br><br>
There has been a dramatic restructuring of how corporate R&D is performed (from
in-house to elaborate outsourcing) and where R&D resources are spent. A key trend is
that newly industrialized countries (India, China) are emerging as a preferred location
to outsource corporate R&D. Kuznetsov (2006a, 2006b) distinguishes among several
types of networks that have resulted from what he calls the broader phenomenon of
“diaspora”:<br><br>
1. Technology and R&D outsourcing networks (e.g., the Indian “Top Executives”
model): Indian executives in major multinationals influence investment
decisions to outsource knowledge-intensive operations to India. Pandey et al.
(2004) discuss how the “Indian Diaspora” has facilitated growth in knowledgeintensive
sectors in the United States, and how this has, in turn, played a decisive
role in the emergence of the knowledge-intensive service sector in India.10<br><br>


2. Cross-border investor networks (e.g., China’s “Bamboo Network”): Diaspora
members know well the reality of their home country and have access to riskmitigation
strategies. Personal trust between members of cross-border investor
networks also reduces transaction costs.<br><br>
3. Scanning networks (Israel, Armenia, India): Diaspora members identify niches
and new opportunities, set new strategic directions, and translate global opportunities
into business projects.<br><br>
4. Brain circulation networks (China, South Korea): Home countries may provide
incentives (such as special technology parks in China) for S&E talent to
return.11<br><br>
Science and Technology Forecast: India and China in 2025<br><br>
Based on (1) the policy objectives described above and (2) GDP growth derived from
past and current macroeconomic performance and R&D investment, we have projected
the main R&D indicators for China and India. The projections are based on an
“accounting model” driven by GDP estimates obtained as an exogenous variable from
the meta-analysis summarized in Chapter Three. The model includes parameters with
several ratios (e.g., number of researchers = GERD × [GDP/cost per researcher]) that
assume that the cost per researcher will remain close to constant in PPP U.S. dollars.
The parameters are based on the same information (from OECD and the governments
of India and China) as the R&D statistics presented earlier in this chapter. This
“constant returns to scale” linear model with ratios estimated from the current data
allows quantitative estimates that are relatively simple and clean, though questions
can be raised about the underlying assumptions.12 These are discussed in the next section.
Simplicity provides a useful tool for considering where countries may be in terms
of prospective demands for HRST and their expected contribution to innovation (as
measured by patents and publications).<br><br>


lternative scenarios for cost per researcher and productivity per researcher (defined
as number of patents per researcher). For both parameters, we assume as the likeliest
scenario that both India and China will converge toward levels observed in more
developed countries. This scenario is supported by the experience of South Korea, a
good benchmark in Asia. Our model and projections could be easily extended to other
changes in exogenous parameters, such as differing rates of economic growth.
That technological progress contributes to economic growth is a central insight of
the endogenous growth literature. In several of the canonical models, the assumption
is that more resources invested in R&D lead to increasing growth rates (Romer, 1990;
Aghion and Howitt, 1992). This is in sharp contrast to the traditional neoclassical,
exogenous technological progress, growth model. Attempts to establish the direction
of causality and, thus, the distinction between exogenous and endogenous growth
models, have been the focus of much of the economic growth literature.13
Recognizing the conceptual complexities of the issue (e.g., is technological progress
exogenous or endogenous?), we estimate the main indicators of S&T of China and
India by utilizing a very simple model that considers technological progress as exogenous
to economic growth.<br><br>
Projection<br><br>
Our goal is to project the size and components of GERD as a proportion of GDP for
China and India; the HRST; and the main indicators of output, patents and number
of publications. The projection proceeds from the GDP growth rate and then estimates
the unknown variables.<br><br>
The exogenous variable is the rate of GDP growth under alternative scenarios.<br><br>
The unknown variables are as follows:<br><br>
 GERD in U.S. dollars of 2008 PPP<br><br>
 GERD components in U.S. dollars of 2008 PPP<br><br>
 number of full-time researchers (FTRs)<br><br>
 number of Ph.D. diplomas in S&E<br><br>
 number of triadic patents<br><br>
 number of publications in S&E.<br><br>
The model includes the following parameters and assumptions:<br><br>
 GERD as a percentage of GDP is based on India’s and China’s 11th Plans:<br><br>
CC for India, 2.5 percent in 2013 and 2025<br><br>
CC for China, 2 percent in 2010 and 2.5 percent in 2025<br><br>

 GERD components (HERD, BERD, GOVERD, and PNPERD) are determined
by convergence toward the average over the 1995C2005 period for two
benchmark countries, Japan and South Korea. We selected Japan as one benchmark
because of its early attainment of S&T indicators on par with those of the
EU and the United States, and South Korea because it has experienced a rapid
increase in its S&T indicators in the last two decades. Although in the long run
we expect both China’s and India’s S&T indicators to converge to those observed
in the industrialized world, we feel that over the time frame 2010C2025 it is more
reasonable to expect China’s and India’s S&T parameters to converge to South
Korea’s current parameters.<br><br>
 The average cost of an R&D FTR is estimated at 2007 PPP conversion to dollars
and remains constant in our cost projections.<br><br>
 Number of researchers = (total cost of R&D)/(average cost of an R&D FTR).<br><br>
 Number of Ph.D. diplomas in S&E per number of researchers C Year = The corresponding
ratio in 2003.<br><br>
 Patents per FTR determined for each country by its average over the 1995C
2005 period.<br><br>
We provide more detailed descriptions of how these parameters are calculated in
Appendix B.<br><br>
Summary Alternative Scenarios. We present four alternative scenarios. Scenario 1
considers the current S&T parameters in China and India. This first scenario may be
considered too conservative, due to the expectation that economic growth and integration
with the rest of the world will boost changes in behavior in many sectors, including
S&T.<br><br>
For that reason, we consider two alternative scenarios in which we change some
R&D parameters to match those of South Korea, one of the countries that we use
as benchmarks. In each of these two alternative scenarios, we move only one of the
parameters in the model to the benchmark level and estimate the variables of interest
according to that change. In Scenario 2, we assume that cost per FTR will converge
to the level in South Korea. In Scenario 3, we assume that the numbers of triadic
patents and S&E publications per FTR―which we hereafter refer to as “researcher
productivity”―for China and India will converge to those of South Korea.<br><br>
The last scenario, Scenario 4, discounts the researcher productivity numbers
based on the sharply different employability rates for engineers from China versus
those from India. As discussed previously, McKinsey Global Institute (2005) reports
that, in a 2005 survey of multinational executives, only 10 percent of Chinese engineers
were considered employable, versus 25 percent for India. Hence, in Scenario 4,
we assume an imputed productivity for Indian engineers 60 percent higher than that
for Chinese engineers.<br><br>

The four scenarios are summarized as follows:<br><br>
 Scenario 1: Current Cost FTR/Current Researcher Productivity<br><br>
 Scenario 2: South Korea’s Cost FTR/Current Research Productivity<br><br>
 Scenario 3: South Korea’s Researcher Productivity FTR/Current Cost per
Researcher<br><br>
 Scenario 4: Number of engineers adjusted according to the employability study
by McKinsey Global.<br><br>
We provide detailed descriptions of the calculations for each scenario in Appendix
B. We present the results of our projections in Tables 4.3 and 4.4. Table 4.3 shows
the estimated number of researchers, S&E Ph.D.’s, patents, and S&E publications for
China and India for each of the four scenarios through 2025; the results in Table 4.3
are also depicted graphically in Figures B.1CB.4 in Appendix B. Table 4.4 shows estimates
for GERD and its four components for each country through 2025.<br><br>
Discussion<br><br>
The results presented in Tables 4.3 and 4.4 clearly show that, based on the constantreturns-
to-scale model, the objectives presented in India’s and China’s national plans
are too ambitious for both countries, especially in terms of the “standard” measures of
output, publications and patents. Overall, the estimates seem too ambitious in terms
of intermediate outputs―especially human resources, given the current problems
both countries face in terms of producing sufficient quantity and/or quality of S&T
personnel.<br><br>
Researchers and other R&D personnel may be working in less-than-ideal conditions
in terms of institutional framework and support, because their productivity, as
measured by the number of triadic patents and publications per FTR, is still at very
low levels. These observed low levels may be rooted in each country’s relative isolation
from the global economy in terms of innovation and human capital quality and basing
its competitiveness on cheap labor. As China’s and India’s economies become more
competitive in terms of S&T graduates, they will improve the environment for innovation
as well. The alternative scenarios presented consider the types of changes that we
considered reasonable to expect in the 15-year time frame of our analysis.<br><br>
The projection numbers should be taken with caution, though they are likely to
be robust for examining relative comparisons. On the one hand, some assumptions―
such as the constant “productivity” of researchers in terms of publication and patents
and the invariability of the cost per researcher (especially in China, which exhibits a
very low cost)―could be questioned. Nevertheless, the changes China is introducing
in its higher education sector aimed at increasing productivity in research and teaching
constitute a basis for optimism. On the other hand, this exercise is purely quantitative;
it does not incorporate either government’s policies, which may affect its portfolio of R&D investment (and, thus, patents and publications in absolute and relative
importance worldwide), nor does it include potential extraordinary events that might
threaten the targets set by both countries.<br><br>


A Qualitative Look at China’s and India’s Innovation<br><br>
There are some qualitative aspects of innovation that are not fully reflected in the
“classic” indicators of innovation. Some of these aspects relate to changes that China
and India are making, and some relate to changes in the dynamics of the innovation
process. The structure of business relationships has changed tremendously in the past
decade, with increasing fragmentation in the production process and increasing diversity
of business models, involving a multitude of players who are distributed worldwide
and reallocation of capital flows around the globe. India, China, and Brazil, among
others, have benefited from this trend, which is changing the innovation markets as a
consequence.<br><br>
“Reverse Innovation” and the Bottom of the Pyramid<br><br>
In the past few decades, innovation has taken a new form. Instead of adapting to the
models that proved to be successful in the developed world, entrepreneurs in emerging
economies are changing the nature of the business. They are introducing innovations
with the aim of reaching the huge market represented by China and India. When marketing
to low-income customers, the income of customers is less significant than their
collective spending power.14 Low per capita income squeezes the profit margins, thus
the companies are counting on volume to compensate. For example, the cash flows

of emerging countries’ low-income customers follow a different path; most of these
customers are paid daily rather than weekly or monthly, and their income is much
more unstable than in the developed world, making them acutely sensitive to price
(Anderson and Markides, 2007).<br><br>
The deep differences between developed and emerging world markets have challenged
Indian engineers to reinvent products and cut costs and have fostered innovation
in distribution, commercialization, and marketing chains. This phenomenon,
known as “reverse innovation,”15 is forcing restructuring of business by multinationals
and by well-established Indian corporations (Govindarajan and Trimble, 2009).16
There are many examples of Indian innovations that are designed specifically for
a massive, low-income market: a wood-burning stove at US$23, a US$34 water purification
system, a US$70 refrigerator that runs with batteries, a baby’s heart monitoring
system at 10 percent of the world price, etc. Some of these Indian innovations may end
up in developed markets. For example, Tata Motors plans to introduce its Nano automobile
to Europe, albeit with improved interiors and new safety features. Though the
European version will be more expensive than the Indian one, it will be significantly
cheaper than alternatives in Europe.<br><br>
Chinese entrepreneurs have had similar successful experiences. For instance,
Galanz, a former textile and garment manufacturer, started its “microwaves for the
masses” endeavor in 1992: It now has a 35 percent world share in the microwave industry.
It competes via innovation (a small, simple, energy-efficient product) instead of
China’s traditional cheap labor strategy (Anderson and Markides, 2007).<br><br>
Reverse innovations extend to the marketing and distribution stages. As one business
strategist puts it, “Companies need to learn to create markets” (Donohue, 2009).
Although the objective is always the same―to reach consumers―marketing and distribution
chains need to adapt to low purchasing power. Reaching the “bottom of the
pyramid” requires different strategies than the ones used in the developed world. Lack
of awareness of these elements has turned carefully “invented products” into failure.17
Successful distribution models now need to be based on rural self-help groups and
micro lenders plugged into villages.<br><br>
This type of innovation, low priced and based in low R&D costs, is changing the
dynamic of innovation and business in the world and makes forecasting S&T indicators
more complex (Bellman, 2009).<br><br>

High-End Innovation<br><br>
Classically associated with low-level IT work, Indian and Chinese companies have
climbed the value chain to become R&D providers in more complex areas. India is
rapidly becoming the next global center of research, design, and innovation for many
industries, including pharmaceutical (drug discovery, specialty pharmaceuticals, biologics,
high value, bulk and advanced intermediate manufacturing); aerospace (inflight
entertainment, airline seat design, collision control/navigation; control systems,
fuel inverting controls, first-class cabin design); consumer appliances (semiconductors,
washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, digital TV, cell phones), and motorized vehicles
(automobiles, tractors, locomotive) (Wadhwa, 2009b).<br><br>
China is already the world’s biggest exporter of computers, telecom equipment,
and other high-tech electronics and is making rapid progress in infrastructure and
technology. China will soon be an export powerhouse in industries such as semiconductors,
passenger cars, and specialty chemicals, and, in 10 to 15 years, commercial
airplanes. But the country faces challenges, including a poor reputation for protecting
intellectual property rights that has prevented multinationals from transferring technology
to China. China’s relatively poor human capital threatens both innovation and
profitability in some industries because final products cannot compete in the market
due to low quality (e.g., chips).<br><br>
India, on the other hand, has an innovation market that is running at high speed
as a consequence of trends that favor domestic investment in high-value tasks. The
positive trends are (Wadhwa, 2008) as follows:<br><br>
1. an increase in education level, productivity, and quality of the workforce as a
consequence of companies’ investment in workforce education
2. a decrease in attrition rates due to companies’ internal promotion strategies (tied
to the improvement in quality) that give incentives for workers to stay and add
to their human capital<br><br>
3. an increase in global competitiveness due to the devaluation of the rupee<br><br>
4. outsourcing to India due to changing business models in developed countries<br><br>
5. recent U.S. immigration policy, which has encouraged skilled workers to return
or stay in India<br><br>
6. the improvement in quality and quantity of engineers: In 2004, India graduated
only 125,000 bachelors in engineering, and the number doubled by 2007 and is
expected to reach a half-million by 2011.<br><br>
In some industries, India and China are making huge progress, particularly in
the highest-value segments of global value chains.18 For example, in the pharmaceutical industry, several new business models have emerged: original proprietary research<br><br>
in which domestic firms provide the basic research and team up with a multinational
company to advance the entire clinical-trial process and market worldwide; research
partnerships; contract research organizations (CROs) that develop specific stages of the
drug discovery process; and generics―India has an edge in the development of generics
at lower costs.<br><br>
Other Approximations to R&D<br><br>
Patents tell only part of the story. Another way to approximate R&D is to follow
the flow of investments. There are many examples of multinationals setting up their
R&D operations and partnering with local firms in India (e.g., Palm Pre smart phone,
Amazon Kindle). Currently, IBM, Big Blue, Cisco, Adobe, Cadence, Oracle, and
Microsoft are developing mainstream products in India. This trend in multinational
R&D operations is parallel to the growth of Indian multinationals such as Tata (produces
the Nano car) and Reva (builds an electric car factory in New York State). China
has had a similar experience but with different players.<br><br>
Nevertheless, both countries have a weakness relating to very scarce venture activity
and to entrepreneurism. Venture capital activity is considered a necessary starting
point to business.19 Wadhwa (2009b) reports that, in the first nine months of 2008,
total early stage venture capital investments in India totaled $678 million, compared
with the United States’ $5.2 billion. China is ahead of India in terms of startups, which
are mostly based on government incentives, but it is still lagging well behind startups
in the United States.20<br><br>
We could place these factors into a second category of human capital quality that
we could name “entrepreneurial” talent, which has been found to have a decisive role of
entrepreneurship in economic growth (Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1991). Murphy,
Shleifer, and Vishny’s 1991 study provided evidence that countries that reward more
entrepreneurship activities than rent-seeking individuals grow faster. Recent studies
using panel data on entrepreneurship (e.g., Acs et al., 2005) have not only confirmed
those early findings but have highlighted the role of entrepreneurship as a mechanism
that facilitates the spillover of knowledge promoting economic growth. Although we
do not have statistically significant information of the relevance of this factor in India
and China, we provide in the text examples that suggest that this quality factor operates
on India’s side. Moreover, India has not only the advantage of language (English)
but also a long tradition of young people doing graduate studies abroad, especially in


the United States. Unfortunately, we do not have enough evidence to assess the impact
of this factor on future trends.<br><br>
Conclusions<br><br>
The evidence presented in this chapter suggests that performance in science, technology,
and innovation has continued to strengthen in recent years worldwide, but especially
in China and India. China and India have become major destinations for foreign
direct investment (FDI).21 They are increasing the share of high-technology products
and services in their export structures.<br><br>
Both countries understand that S&T plays a crucial role in achieving economic
growth. Consequently, in their five-year plans, they have set levels of R&D expenditure
similar to those of industrialized countries. They have also set other measures
and policy instruments in support of S&T. Plans include policy instruments aimed
to improve the environment for R&D investment (legal environment for innovation,
such as protecting innovation rights), foster linkages between the business and the
higher education sectors, and focus on areas of research that represent urgent need
for the countries’ population (such as environment, biotechnology, and agriculture,
among others).<br><br>
However, raising R&D intensity to a level close to that of OECD countries is a
challenge that requires several changes. These include, for example, migration from
experimental to basic research; a more prominent role for the business sector as a performer
of R&D (in both countries but eventually more in India); more connection
between business and the higher education sector, which is necessary for successful
innovation systems; and an increase in the quality of education to support both basic
and applied research.<br><br>
The higher education sector, as the main producer of intermediate outputs
(including graduates in S&E), is also facing challenges in terms of the quantity and the
quality of the human resources it produces. The challenge is immense; the expansion
of GERD is projected to levels that will demand important increases in the number of
graduates.<br><br>
From our point of view, despite China’s success to date, there is a mismatch
between its investment in S&T and its innovation impact, as proxied by the number
of patents and publications. The opinion of the business sector expressed at the Global
Economic Forum confirms the difficulties in creating an innovative environment in
China (Global Economic Forum, no date). Although entrepreneurs have highlighted
difficulties associated with the institutional organizations for both countries as important barriers to investment, China appears to be lagging behind not only in efficiency
but also in lack of competitiveness of its human capital. While India faces its own challenges,
mainly related to the financial sector, its strong presence at the high end of the
value chain combined with innovations addressed to low-income consumers make it
likely to become a more important player in S&T in the coming decades.<br><br>
Finally, our study highlights the crucial need for better statistics. This includes
the harmonization of quality standards and definitions at cross-country levels. Further,
important information on R&D activities is not collected or is highly aggregated and
not consistent with international definitions. For instance, information is incomplete
about the activities of multinational companies in China that affect supply of and
demand for HRST. Harmonization of concepts and systematic collection of uncollected
information will facilitate international comparisons and enable a more accurate
analysis of current and future trends.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">CHAPTER FIVE Chinese and Indian Defense and Defense Procurement Spending to 2025</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
As discussed in previous chapters, just as India’s and China’s endowments―vast populations,
growing and increasingly sophisticated and diversified economies, and growing
technology sectors―contribute to their growing strategic importance, so too do their
substantial and growing defense capabilities. Accordingly, understanding the outlook
for Indian and Chinese long-term defense and defense procurement is a crucial dimension
of our comparative assessment of the two countries. In this chapter, we summarize
our comparative analysis and forecasts of Chinese and Indian defense and defense
procurement spending through 2025.<br><br>
The main findings can be briefly stated as follows:<br><br>
 The most likely outcome in 2025 is that Chinese defense spending will continue
to exceed that of India, and the ratio of Chinese to Indian spending is likely to
continue in China’s favor, or even grow.<br><br>
 Chinese defense procurement spending also appears likely to continue to exceed
that of India, but it is plausible that the ratio of Chinese to Indian spending could
either grow or shrink.<br><br>
 India’s defense and defense procurement spending are more transparent than
China’s, because of the public and detailed nature of India’s public budgeting process.
For its part, China’s policy of reporting its defense and defense procurement
spending in terms of budgetary aggregates probably omits substantial amounts of
defense-related spending.<br><br>
 It is easier to establish a rough floor on Chinese spending than a ceiling. Official
U.S. estimates of Chinese defense spending are as much as two to three times
higher than China’s official estimate of defense expenditures.<br><br>
 Under many―perhaps most―plausible circumstances, the recently observed
high levels of double-digit growth in defense and defense procurement spending in both China and India will likely be politically unsustainable well before 2025.<br><br>
It will therefore be important to carefully monitor the Chinese and Indian leadership
discourse for signs that growth in defense spending will be tapering off.
 Indeed, China’s recent announcement that defense spending in 2010 will grow by
only 7.5 percent―about half the rate of growth of the previous year―and India’s
announcement that defense growth in 2010C2011 will be about 4 percent―
compared with more than 20 percent growth in the previous year―suggest that
both countries’ defense budgets already are under pressure as a result of competing
domestic demands.<br><br>
 Many other international and domestic “wild cards” could affect the future trajectory
of Indian and Chinese defense and defense procurement spending; a detailed
analysis of these factors would be a useful complement to the present effort.
This chapter is divided into four parts. The first part describes the approach used
for our analyses and forecasts. The second part reviews, summarizes, and critiques
official unclassified sources of data on defense and defense procurement spending for
both India and China, as well as data from other studies dealing with defense spending
by the two countries. This review concludes with a set of baseline estimates of Chinese
and Indian defense and defense procurement spending in 2009. The third part
of the chapter presents a range of comparative forecasts of Chinese and Indian defense
and defense procurement spending from the 2009 baseline figures through 2025 with
varying assumptions about growth, GDP share of defense, and other factors. We close
with comparative observations about the two countries, based on our analyses and
forecasts, and conclusions.<br><br>
Appendix C contains tables with detailed historical data on GDP and defense
and defense procurement spending, estimates of nominal and real growth in these
aggregates, implicit deflators used to convert spending estimates from nominal to real
growth rates, exchange rates, and other technical assumptions related to the analyses
and forecasts.<br><br>
Analytic Approach<br><br>
To understand the composition of Chinese and Indian defense spending, the analysis
begins with a review of scholarly efforts that have analyzed Chinese and Indian defense
spending.2<br><br>


The main line of our research was based on a review of openly available Englishlanguage
primary and secondary sources, especially official documents and public
statements, with modest reliance on Chinese-language sources.3<br><br>
Historical GDP and defense and defense procurement spending data through
2009 were compiled in local currency units (LCUs) in current prices, i.e., Chinese renminbi
(RMB) or Indian rupees (INR),4 and historical real growth rates were estimated
using implicit price deflators from the International Monetary Fund.5<br><br>
We produced several dozen alternative forecasts of defense and defense procurement
spending in 2025, with the estimated 2009 levels of defense and defense procurement
spending and GDP serving as baselines for all of these forecasts.<br><br>
Our “defense growth rate” forecasts of defense and defense procurement spending
were predicated on alternative assumptions about the future average annual real
growth in defense and defense procurement expenditures. For example, we used recent
historical trends in the annual average real growth rates of defense and defense procurement
spending and GDP through 2009 as the basis for some of our forecasts of defense
and defense procurement spending levels from their 2009 baselines through 2025. To
bound these forecasts, we also generated alternative forecasts assuming plausibly lower
and higher real growth rates than the actual ones that have recently occurred.
An alternative set of “parametric” forecasts of defense spending relied on different
combinations of assumptions about the average annual real growth rates in Chinese
and Indian GDP and their corresponding defense shares of GDP.<br><br>
Thus, within each of these two types of forecast―“defense growth rate” and
“parametric”―we used varying assumptions to explore the wider range of plausible
trajectories in defense and defense procurement spending to 2025.<br><br>
Finally, to directly compare Chinese and Indian spending, we converted the
defense spending and defense procurement spending estimates from constant 2009
local currency units―INR or RMB―to constant 2009 U.S. dollars using both market
exchange rates (MXR) and purchasing power parity (PPP).6<br><br>

Baseline Estimates for China<br><br>
Crane et al. (2005) reported that “the official Chinese defense budget excludes a wide
variety of military accounting items commonly included in Western budgets” and provided
a “notional full Chinese military budget” consisting of the following elements:7<br><br>
 the official Chinese defense budget<br><br>
 paramilitaries (People’s Armed Police, PAP)<br><br>
 local support to defense and paramilitaries<br><br>
 funds for foreign arms imports8<br><br>
 defense research and development (R&D)<br><br>
 defense industrial subsidies9<br><br>
 foreign arms sales revenues.10<br><br>
Analysts also have identified a number of additional categories of defense spending
and suspected sources of additional defense resources that are not easily estimated
from Chinese budget documents.11<br><br>

Using a slightly modified version of Crane et al.’s framework,12 we estimated China’s
total defense spending in 2009.13<br><br>
We began with the official Chinese defense expenditure estimate of 481 billion
RMB in 2009 and added state, provincial, and local funding for PAP paramilitary
forces (about 75 billion RMB) and estimated arms imports in 2009 (about 10 billion
RMB).14<br><br>
We then estimated defense-related R&D and government-funded science and
technology (S&T) in 2009.15 We did this by increasing the IISS estimates for 2008
(46.1 billion RMB in defense-related R&D and 34.5 billion RMB in defense-related
government-funded S&T) by the estimated growth rate in the official Chinese defense
budget from 2008 to 2009 (14.9 percent). Thus, we assume that the growth in nominal
defense-related R&D between 2008 and 2009 was at the same rate as the nominal
growth rate in China’s official defense budget during the same period. This yielded an
estimated total of 53 billion RMB in defense-related R&D and 40 billion RMB in
S&T spending in 2009 current prices.16<br><br>

Our estimate of about eight billion RMB in revenues from foreign arms sales in
2009 was subtracted from our estimate of the defense share of defense industry group
revenues, described next. We did not attempt to estimate the profits or commissions
from foreign arms sales that might be used to advance Chinese military purposes, as
most contemporary scholars appear to view these profits and commissions as modest.17
In any event, the amounts involved have a negligible effect on the bottom-line estimates
for defense spending.<br><br>
Our estimate differs from most others in one other important respect: our handling
of Defense Industry Group (DIG) revenues. China’s ten DIGs are state-owned
enterprises responsible for the indigenous production of Chinese defense goods and,
increasingly, a range of civilian goods such as commercial ships, aircraft, and electronics
as well. In theory, DIG revenues related to defense production should approximately
equal the total of the “Equipment” account in the official budget, plus foreign
arms sales of defense goods produced by the DIGs. Building on Surry’s earlier effort
to estimate the defense-related revenues of China’s DIGs (Surry, 2007), we estimated
total DIG revenues for 2009 by projecting 14.9 percent nominal growth over the estimated
2008 level of 909 billion RMB, or 1,044 billion RMB. Using Surry’s 2007
estimate that up to 35 percent of defense industry group revenues was defense-related
and evidence that this share has been declining, we then assumed three alternative
defense shares of total DIG revenues: a “low” estimate of 20 percent, a “mid” estimate
of 25 percent, and a “high” estimate of 30 percent. We then subtracted from the resulting
estimates of defense-related revenues the official Chinese estimate for the “Equipment”
account of defense spending and estimated foreign arms sales.18 This yielded
an estimated 41 to 145 billion RMB in revenues, depending on whether the defense
share of DIG revenues was assumed to be 20, 25, or 30 percent of total revenues (see
Table 5.1).19<br><br>
That all of the estimates of defense-related DIG revenues exceeded the sum of
the “Equipment” account and estimated foreign arms sales suggests that the difference
may be a form of off-budget defense spending. As a practical matter, we used our
middle estimate of defense-related DIG revenues in 2009 for our baseline estimates

and forecasts and simply note that there is some uncertainty about the true value of
those revenues.20<br><br>
As just discussed, our estimate of total Chinese defense spending in 2009 is based
on the official estimate of 481 billion RMB, plus spending on the PAP (75 billion
RMB); foreign arms purchases (10 billion RMB); defense research and development
(53 billion RMB); government-funded defense science and technology (40 billion
RMB); and net DIG revenues of 41, 93, or 145 billion RMB, the number depending
on whether the defense share of DIG revenues is assumed to be 20, 25, or 30 percent.
Based on these estimates, our middle estimate of Chinese defense spending in 2009 is
752 billion RMB, with a range of plus or minus 52 billion RMB (about 6.9 percent),
or 700 to 804 billion RMB, depending on the assumed defense share of DIG revenues.
Our estimates are between 2.1 and 2.4 percent of Chinese GDP in 2009,21 higher
than the official Chinese estimate of 1.38 percent of GDP and generally in line with
other studies.22 However, these other estimates do not include net defense industry

group revenues, but they are reasonably close to those in recent press reporting on Chinese
defense and military spending levels.23<br><br>
In estimating Chinese defense procurement, we include the official Chinese estimate
of spending on “Equipment,” estimated foreign arms purchases, and net defense
industry group revenues, which leads to an estimate of 211 to 315 billion RMB in
defense procurement spending, or 30C40 percent of total defense spending (see
Table 5.2).<br><br>
As just described, because of the many gaps and uncertainties in China’s defense
procurement and defense spending data, our baseline estimates are necessarily partial;
we have included only those elements we could estimate with some confidence. Put
another way, these estimates generally should be viewed as floors on Chinese defense
procurement and defense spending.<br><br>
Baseline Estimates for India<br><br>
India’s annual Union Budget is detailed in a large number of “Demands for Grants”
(DGs) that contain the government of India’s requested budget levels for its various
ministries, departments, and other governmental activities, as well as updated estimates
of spending in prior years.24 In India’s budgetary parlance, “Demands for Grants” correspond
generally to what in U.S. terminology would be the Department of Defense
part of the budget request submitted to the Congress by the president.<br><br>

Table 5.3 presents recent budgets and spending levels for the eight “Demands for
Grants” that are associated with India’s Ministry of Defence and that constitute India’s
spending on national defense.<br><br>
As shown in the table, total planned Indian defense spending for 2009C2010 was
1,666.6 billion rupees, a nominal increase of 21.4 percent over the 2008C2009 defense
spending level.<br><br>
Also shown in the table, the top three defense requirements for the 2009C2010
budget year were Capital Outlays, the Indian Army, and Pensions, accounting for
about three-fourths of total estimated spending by the Ministry of Defence that year.
Moreover, spending on the Indian Army was more than four times the spending on the
Indian Air Force and seven times the spending on the Indian Navy. Whereas Capital
Outlays make up almost one-third of total defense spending, research and development
make up less than one-thirtieth of the total defense budget.<br><br>
Because India does not consider spending on paramilitary forces to be part of
its spending on national defense, we do not include this spending by the Indian Ministry
of Home Affairs in our overall estimate of Indian defense spending. The reader
will recall, however, that the Chinese do consider its paramilitary force―the People’s
Armed Police―to be part of its national defense, and we accordingly include spending
on the PAP in our defense spending estimate for China. What difference would the
inclusion of Indian spending on paramilitary forces make to our overall defense spending
estimates for India?<br><br>


As described in Table 5.4, we estimate Indian spending on the Ministry of Home
Affairs’ paramilitary forces in 2009C2010 to be about 230 billion INR. Thus, if paramilitary-
related spending is added to Indian defense spending, the total would be
nearly 1.9 trillion INR (1,667 billion INR for defense plus 230 billion INR for paramilitary
forces), or about 13.8 percent higher than our estimate of Indian defense
spending alone. Thus, although the inclusion of Indian spending on paramilitaries
would enhance conceptual comparability and narrow the gap between the two countries’
defense-related spending, we have chosen to rely on each country’s policy regarding the relationship between defense and its paramilitary forces.25 Definitions aside,<br><br>
as a practical matter, in interpreting our forecasts, readers should keep in mind that if
Indian paramilitaries are included in Indian defense spending, our forecasts for Indian
defense spending may be nearly 14 percent higher.<br><br>
India’s spending on defense nuclear, missile, and space capabilities is not well documented,
a point also emphasized in our earlier discussion of China’s defense spending.<br><br>
According to a recent analysis:<br><br>
National defence accounts for 13 percent of the central government expenditure
and if military-and-security-related components of other ministries or departments
like the Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Atomic Energy and Department
of Space are taken into consideration, the larger national security considerations
actually consume more than 20 percent of total expenditure.26<br><br>
Thus, our analysis of national securityCrelated spending by other ministries
included a review of spending by India’s Departments of Atomic Energy and Space.
Table 5.4 describes the 2009C2010 budgets of India’s Department of Atomic Energy,
which is responsible for the development of Indian nuclear weapons and missilery, and
spending by the Department of Space, which is responsible for other defense-related
space capabilities. The lack of explicit treatment of defense nuclear, missile, and space
activities in Indian budget documents makes it almost impossible to estimate Indian
spending on nuclear weapon and defense space programs from the budget documents.<br><br>
Compared with India’s roughly 1.7 trillion rupees for defense spending and the
Ministry of Home Affairs’ 230 billion rupees for paramilitary capabilities, the budgets
of these departments―less than 100 billion rupees for the Department of Atomic
Energy and 40 billion rupees for the Department of Space―are quite small relative
to overall Indian national security spending. The small amounts associated with the
Departments of Atomic Energy and Space may mean that some of the costs related to
nuclear weapons and missiles and defense space activities are hidden elsewhere in the
Indian budget. We conclude from this analysis of available data that Indian spending
on defense, nuclear, missile, and space capabilities remains as much of a puzzle as
Chinese spending on these capabilities: In neither case are we able to provide a reliable
estimate.<br><br>


Baseline Estimate of Indian Defense Procurement Spending
Of the Indian Ministry of Defence’s eight Demands for Grants, three―related to
Capital Outlays, Coast Guard Organisation, and Defence Ordnance Factories―are
directly related to procurement (see Table 5.5)<br><br>

As shown in the table, we estimate total Indian defense procurement spending in
2009C2010 at about 445 billion rupees, or a little over one-quarter of overall Indian
defense spending.27<br><br>
In addition to these procurement-related accounts, a fourth Demand for Grants―
Research and Development (No. 26)―also contributes to the defense research, development,
and acquisition functions―with spending pegged at nearly 48 billion INR
in 2009C2010.<br><br>
Finally, as described above, it is not clear where procurement related to defense
nuclear and missile programs takes place, e.g., whether it is conducted within the Ministry
of Defence or by the Departments of Atomic Energy and Space. However, the
defense-related spending of these departments is nowhere elaborated and remains a key
uncertainty in estimating overall Indian defense procurement spending.
Using the baseline Chinese and Indian levels just described, we now provide our
estimates of Chinese and Indian defense and defense procurement spending in 2025.
Comparative Forecasts of Defense and Defense Procurement Spending
in 2025<br><br>
We conducted two types of forecasts of Chinese and Indian defense spending in 2025,
both of which used the estimates of the 2009 baseline levels of spending, described
above, as a starting point:<br><br>
 The first, which we call “defense growth rate” forecasts, projected real growth in
defense spending at various constant average annual real growth rates from 2010
to 2025.<br><br>
 The second, which we call “parametric” forecasts, assumed several alternative
annual real growth rates in GDP and several alternative GDP shares for defense
spending.<br><br>
Both types of forecasts are described below.<br><br>
Growth Rate Forecasts of Defense Spending in 2025<br><br>
Using estimated defense spending levels in 2009, the mean real GDP growth rates
reported in Chapter Three, and recent trends in real Chinese and Indian defense spending
and real GDP growth over the last decade, we posited several plausible alternative

rates of real growth in these defense aggregates and generated a wide range of alternative
forecasts based on these different growth rate assumptions. Each forecast assumes
a different annual growth rate that is sustained throughout the 2010C2025 period.28
As described above, between our higher and lower estimates, the middle estimate
of Chinese defense spending in 2009 is 752 billion RMB, which translates to
110.1 billion U.S. dollars (MXR), or 201.1 billion U.S. dollars (PPP). The estimate of
Indian defense spending in 2009 is 1,666.6 billion INR, which translates to 34.4 billion
U.S. dollars (MXR), or 101.2 billion U.S. dollars (PPP). Thus, the ratio of Chinese
to Indian defense spending in 2009 is estimated at 2.0 to 3.2, depending on whether
PPP-based or market exchange rates are used. Applying PPP conversion rates raises the
Indian estimate relative to that of China.<br><br>
Table 5.6 presents a range of forecasts based on different assumptions about the
average annual real growth in Chinese and Indian defense spending from 2010 to
2025:<br><br>
 The “GDP Meta-Analysis” forecasts in Table 5.6 assume that Chinese and Indian
defense spending will grow at the respective mean GDP annual growth rates from
the meta-analysis of GDP forecasts reported in Chapter Three, i.e., 5.7 percent for
China and 5.6 percent for India.<br><br>
 The “Historical GDP” forecasts in the table assume that Chinese and Indian
defense spending will grow at their respective annual average real GDP growth
rates observed in the decade to 2009, i.e., 10.3 percent for China and 6.9 percent
for India.29<br><br>
 The “Historical Defense” forecasts in the table assume a continuation of defense
spending growth at the annual average real growth rate in defense spending in the
decade to 2009, i.e., 12.1 percent for China and 6.5 percent for India.30
As shown in the ratios of Chinese to Indian defense spending at the bottom
of the table, because China and India are posited to grow at comparable rates, the
“GDP Meta-Analysis” would maintain China’s current advantage in defense spending,
whereas the continuation of recent trends captured in the “Historical GDP” and
“Historical Defense” cases suggests that the gap between the forecasts for Chinese and
Indian defense spending would widen.<br><br>
The results in Table 5.6 suggest that if Indian defense spending grew at the higher
rate of annual historical GDP real growth (6.9 percent), and if China’s defense spending grew at the lower rate of GDP growth (5.7 percent) shown in the meta-analysis
column, India could whittle down China’s defense spending advantage to a ratio of
about 2.6. Judging by the recent history of real growth in defense spending for the two
countries, this combination of circumstances seems implausible but not inconceivable.
Parametric Defense Spending Forecasts Based on Varied Assumptions About Real
GDP Growth Rates and Defense Shares of GDP
Key uncertainties for both India and China include the average real GDP growth rates
of each country through 2025 and the average percentage of GDP that policymakers
in each country will be willing to devote to defense. Accordingly, we generated another

set of forecasts that we call “parametric” forecasts and that revolve around different
assumptions about the defense share of GDP for China and India, as well as their
respective average real GDP growth rates.<br><br>
Given China’s current advantage over India in GDP, it is not surprising that when
Chinese and Indian GDPs are assumed to grow at identical real growth rates and the
defense shares of GDP are identical, China’s defense spending will increase its lead
over India. In these cases, the ratio of Chinese to Indian defense spending in 2025 is
four times larger using market exchange rates, and 2.5 times larger using PPP-based
exchange rates. Are there any combinations of Chinese and Indian GDP growth rates
and defense shares of GDP in which India can reduce China’s advantage in defense
spending by 2025 or even overtake China?<br><br>
To address this question, we generated forecasts of Chinese and Indian defense
spending in 2025 using alternative assumptions that plausibly envelope the recent Chinese
and Indian historical experience in average annual real GDP growth rates (5.0,
7.5, 10.0, and 12.5 percent real growth) and shares of GDP devoted to defense (2.0,
2.5, and 3.0 percent of GDP).31 Using the same set of bounding assumptions for China
and India results in 12 cases for each country (four possible GDP growth rates times
three possible GDP shares), or a total of 144 paired cases.<br><br>
In the case that most favors China, in which China’s average real GDP growth
is 12.5 percent and its defense share of GDP is 3.0 percent, although India grows at
5.0 percent and commits only 2.0 percent to defense, the ratio of Chinese to Indian
defense spending can be as high as 11.4 (PPP) to 18.3 (MXR). On the other hand,
only in the case where Indian GDP grows at the highest real growth rate (12.5 percent)
and its defense share is 3 percent, and China’s GDP grows at the lowest growth rate
(5.0 percent) and its defense share is 2 percent, can Indian defense spending approach,
or surpass, that of China.<br><br>
To conclude this discussion of defense spending forecasts, the results strongly suggest
that China’s margin over India in defense spending is likely to continue or grow
by 2025.<br><br>
Growth Rate Forecasts of Defense Procurement Spending in 2025
Our forecasts of Chinese and Indian defense procurement spending in 2025 suggest
that China is also likely to retain its advantage in the area of spending on military
modernization (see Table 5.7).<br><br>
Table 5.7 summarizes our forecasts of Chinese and Indian defense procurement
spending using four alternative real growth rates: (1) the mean real GDP growth rates
from the meta-analyses reported in Chapter Three (“GDP Meta-Analysis,” 5.7 and 5.6 percent real growth); (2) each country’s historically observed real GDP growth
rates over the last decade (“Historical GDP,” 10.3 and 6.9 percent for China and India,
respectively); (3) each country’s historically observed real rate of growth in defense
spending over the last decade (“Historical Defense,” 12.1 and 6.5 percent); and (4) each
country’s historically observed real rate of growth in defense procurement spending
over the last decade (“Historical Procurement,” 12.8 percent). We also report the ratio of Chinese to Indian defense procurement spending in 2025 for each pair of these
growth rate assumptions.<br><br>
As described above, we estimate 263 billion RMB in Chinese defense procurement
spending in 2009, which translates to 38.5, or 70.3 billion U.S. dollars (MXR
and PPP, respectively), and 444.9 billion INR in Indian defense procurement spending
in 2009, translating to 9.2, or 27.0 billion U.S. dollars (MXR and PPP, respectively).
The estimated ratio of Chinese to Indian defense procurement spending in 2009 is 2.6
(PPP) or 4.2 (MXR). As noted above, employing PPP conversion rates raises the Indian
estimates relative to those of China.<br><br>
As shown in Table 5.7, because the rates of GDP growth are nearly identical for
China and India, in the “GDP Meta-Analysis” and “Historical Procurement” forecasts,
pairing them has very little effect on the ratio of Chinese to Indian defense procurement
spending by 2025. The remaining two cases―“Historical GDP” and “Historical
Defense”―suggest that China’s spending advantage on defense procurement
could widen. In only one case, where Indian defense procurement grows at the unlikely
“Historical Procurement” rate of 12.8 percent and China’s defense procurement grows
at a rate of 5.7 percent, would India’s defense procurement surpass that of China.
Our analysis of these and other cases suggests that, although it is most likely that
China will enjoy a continued margin over India in defense procurement spending, it is
plausible that China’s margin could either grow or shrink. The results also suggest the
implausibility of India surpassing China in its defense procurement spending in 2025.
Such an outcome would require a combination of a continued high rate of real Indian
growth in defense procurement spending coupled with a low rate of Chinese growth
in its defense procurement.<br><br>
Broader Comparisons<br><br>
Having compared our forecasts of defense and defense procurement spending for India
and China from a quantitative perspective, we now turn to a broader comparison
between the two countries.<br><br>
Update: The Chinese and Indian 2010 Defense Budgets<br><br>
Since the completion of our analysis, in February 2010 India announced its Union
Budget for 2010C2011, including its estimates of defense and defense procurement
spending for the year, and in March 2010 China announced its defense spending plans
for the year. What do the newest defense budget announcements suggest about future
defense and defense procurement levels in each country?<br><br>

Chinese Defense Spending in 2010<br><br>
After 20 years of annual double-digit growth in its official estimate of nominal defense
expenditures, in March 2010 China announced that total Chinese defense spending in
2010 would be 532.1 billion RMB (about 78 billion U.S. dollars) or about 1.4 percent
of GDP; this level of spending reflected growth of only 7.5 percent, about half of the
preceding year’s announced 14.9 percent growth rate.32 The announcement was met
with both surprise and puzzlement by most observers of Chinese military spending,
and its implications for the longer-term trend in Chinese defense spending remain
unclear. At least one implication for the present study is clear, however: Chinese spending
in 2010 is, at least in the short term, likely to be closer to our low forecasts of
defense and defense procurement spending than to our middle and high estimates.<br><br>
Indian Defense Spending in 2010<br><br>
In February 2010 India announced its Union Budget for 2010C2011, including a
budget estimate for defense of 1,473 billion INR (about 31.9 billion U.S. dollars), a
modest increase of 3.98 percent over the previous year’s announced planned spending
level of 1,417 billion INR.33 This reflected a significant reduction in the growth of
Indian defense expenditures and also suggests that our low estimates for Indian defense
growth may best capture the current trend in Indian defense spending. A diminished
Indian appetite for defense spending also appears substantiated by the government
of India’s acceptance of the Thirteenth Finance Commission’s recommendations to
reduce defense’s share of Indian GDP from 2.2 percent in 2009C2010 to 1.76 percent
in to 2014C2015.34 Thus, in India’s case as well, recent developments suggest lower rates
of growth in defense and defense procurement spending that are closer to our low estimates
than to our high ones.<br><br>
Although it is far too early to say with any certainty whether this is the beginning
of a new trend of lower defense spending by China and India, it does give greater
credence to our low estimates of future defense spending, while also highlighting the
challenges of forecasting future defense spending for these two countries.
India or China: Which Is Likely to Have the Edge in 2025?<br><br>
Under the most plausible assumptions, Chinese defense and defense procurement
spending will exceed that of India in 2025, and the ratio of Chinese to Indian spending
will grow. The fact that this result depends on a comparison that favored India
(because of the greater completeness of its spending data), and probably underestimated
China’s spending (because of data gaps), suggests that the gaps in 2025 may
favor China by more than our estimates and forecasts suggest. In addition, reported
ineffectiveness and inefficiencies in the Indian research, development, and acquisition
system suggest that, unless India succeeds in major reforms, the gap between China and
India in the production of actual defense capabilities―quantitative and qualitative―
could be even larger.<br><br>
Guns, Butter, and Defense Share of GDP<br><br>
The rather unexpected and dramatic reduction in both Chinese and Indian defense
growth, and India’s greater volatility in defense spending levels, has two principal
implications.<br><br>
First, it will be important to monitor Indian and Chinese macroeconomic performance,
since higher rates of GDP growth will make higher levels of defense and
defense procurement spending more affordable by shrinking the defense share of
GDP, holding other things constant. Second, it will be crucial to monitor Chinese and
Indian policymakers’ statements on the defense burden, i.e., the desired level of defense
spending as a fraction of GDP, to ascertain their willingness to sustain defense spending
beyond some nominal share of GDP, or to begin placing brakes on the growth in
defense accounts. Indeed, the rather dramatic reduction in defense spending growth by
both India and China in 2010 suggests that “guns versus butter” considerations already
may be increasingly salient in each country’s defense spending decisions.<br><br>
Key Drivers of Defense and Defense Procurement Spending Estimates<br><br>
As described above, our estimates of defense and defense procurement spending were
sensitive to assumptions about what to include (e.g., defense share of Chinese defense
industry group revenues) and exclude (e.g., Indian Ministry of Home Affairs paramilitaries),
which data were available or missing (e.g., estimates of Chinese and Indian
defense spending on defense nuclear and missile capabilities), assumed future average
real GDP, defense spending, defense procurement growth rates over the 2010C2025
period, assumed future defense shares of GDP, and choice of exchange rate (market
or PPP-based) for converting local currency units to constant U.S. dollars. That the
resulting forecasts varied significantly depending on the specific combinations of these
assumptions suggests the nature of the challenges of making predictions 15 years into
the future. Nonetheless, China’s starting advantages in GDP, defense and defense procurement
spending, and a historical record of higher real growth rates in these aggregates confer a substantial edge over India that seems most likely to continue out to
2025.<br><br>
Apples and Oranges: “National Defense” Versus “National Security” Spending
A key factor in comparing estimates of defense and defense procurement spending is
navigating definitional differences regarding what is included in “national defense.”
Indeed, an important distinction between India and China is the way they each define
national defense.<br><br>
As described above, China includes its paramilitary force, the People’s Armed
Police, in its definition of national defense, even though spending on the PAP is not
included in China’s official defense budget estimate but rather is provided under
China’s Ministry for Public Security. By contrast, India’s paramilitary forces, most
of which are housed in the Ministry of Home Affairs, are not considered to be part
of India’s national defense, although they might be considered to be part of Indian
national security.<br><br>
To facilitate direct comparison between India and China, one could either include
India’s spending on paramilitaries (about 230 billion INR in 2009) or drop China’s
(75 billion RMB): The former approach would add about 14 percent to India’s baseline
estimate of 1,667 billion INR in defense spending in 2009C2010, whereas the latter
approach would reduce our middle estimate of Chinese defense spending by about
10 percent. Thus, symmetric treatment of paramilitaries could reduce China’s margin
by 10C14 percent. Although this would not dramatically affect the basic thrust of our
conclusions, these adjustments would make the bilateral comparisons more symmetric.<br><br>
Spending on Strategic Nuclear, Missile, and Space Forces<br><br>
It is not clear how much spending on the personnel, operations, and maintenance of
the Chinese 2nd Artillery Corps, the component of the People’s Liberation Army that
controls China’s nuclear ballistic and conventional missiles, is included in China’s official
estimate of national defense spending and how much might be hidden elsewhere
in the Chinese defense or other (e.g., science and technology) budgets;35 accordingly,
the magnitude of this spending is largely unknown.<br><br>
In a similar vein, spending on Indian strategic nuclear and missile forces was not
broken out in the budget documents we reviewed. Moreover, most analysts believe

that research, development, and acquisition of Indian nuclear and missile forces take
place within the Departments of Atomic Energy and Space, respectively, although the
defense activities of these departments are not separately reported.<br><br>
Thus, spending on defense nuclear and space activities remains a key area of
uncertainty for both China and India.<br><br>
Chinese Opacity and Indian Transparency in Defense Spending
Notwithstanding China’s claims of transparency in its defense budget,36 perhaps the
most significant contrast between India and China is the level of visibility into Indian
national defense and national security spending and the relative opacity of Chinese
spending.<br><br>
Among the major items that most analysts suggest are excluded from the official
Chinese estimate of national defense expenditures are the PAP, local militia, overseas
weapons procurement, defense industry subsidies, defense-related defense industry
group revenues in excess of the official subtotal for defense spending on equipment,
Chinese arms exports, R&D, and defense nuclear and missile capabilities.37 For example,
research, development, and acquisition spending is believed to take place within
the “Equipment” account of China’s official national budget estimate; the defense
industry groups; and a host of scientific, technical, and other organizations; and much
of this spending appears to be undocumented in publicly available documents, at least
those in English.38 Although some of these items are reported elsewhere in the Chinese
state budget (e.g., PAP), other areas of uncertainty warrant further investigation.
In the case of India, four of the defense-related Demands for Grants in India’s
Union Budget―Capital Outlays, Ordnance Factories, Research and Development,
and Ministry of Defence (for the Coast Guard Organisation)―account for the bulk
of Indian defense-related research, development, and acquisition spending, not including
spending related to defense nuclear and missile programs. Our analysis of budget
documents revealed no equivalents to the Chinese defense industry groups or evidence
of subsidies or other off-budget spending on defense or defense procurement. However,
we do not rule out the possibility that such spending or subsidies take place within the
Indian defense system.<br><br>

Conclusions<br><br>
The aim of the analysis presented here is to provide a comparative assessment of Indian
and Chinese defense and defense procurement spending. We have not considered many
strategic and political factors―for example, increased frictions or a warming of relations
between China and India, a Mumbai-style attack that leads to increased spending
to meet terrorist and related threats, or other strategic “wild cards.” We have also
not considered domestic political, organizational, or other societal changes that could
affect defense spending in one or both countries. Such a relevant and complementary
analysis would be valuable, but it was beyond the scope and resources of the present
effort.<br><br>
Our analyses also suggest several areas that warrant more detailed investigation
and analysis.<br><br>
For China, the many areas of opacity and uncertainty regarding its defense and
defense procurement spending have already been emphasized. To realize a complete
understanding of China’s defense spending will present a continuing challenge for
the future. That said, our analysis of Chinese spending relied primarily on Englishlanguage
open-source materials, with a small amount of open-source Chinese materials
providing additional, useful detail. Access to additional Chinese-language sources
might reduce some of the opacity in Chinese defense and defense procurement spending.
Increased transparency might also occur through Track Two meetings (i.e., nongovernment
institutional meetings) with Chinese experts. This could help to identify
additional data sources for estimating Chinese defense spending and to illuminate
such issues as the magnitude of the overlap between official Chinese estimates of
“Equipment”-related spending and the defense shares of defense industry group revenues.
39 Nonetheless, although China claims that its defense budget is completely
transparent,40 the full Chinese defense budget remains a state secret and Chinese
interlocutors openly state that transparency is a tool that strong powers use to compel
weaker parties to reveal their weaknesses and that China, being in a militarily inferior
position to the United States, in fact has little incentive to improve transparency.41
In addition, it is also quite possible that some of India’s defense and defense procurement
spending is hidden from view, buried in other accounts, or provided for in
unregistered inter-ministerial transfers. In particular, although Indian budget documents
suggest that spending on defense-related nuclear and space activities is fairly
modest, we have access only to aggregate data and cannot rule out the possibility that
some spending is hidden. Also, there is little doubt that more detailed and exhaustive

analysis of Indian defense and defense procurement is possible: For example, we did
not have access either to the Budget Service Estimates that reportedly provided additional
detail on India’s armed services’ spending or to the longer-range planning and
budgetary documents, such as the Five Year Defence Plan, which is classified or at least
sensitive. That said, we are unaware of other efforts to provide a comprehensive picture
of Indian defense and defense procurement or to forecast spending through 2025. We
hope that the present effort makes a contribution to these issues.<br><br>
Furthermore, the volatility in recent Chinese and Indian defense spending―
including greatly reduced growth rates for defense in 2010, as discussed above―reveals
the inherent difficulties of using recent historical trends as a basis for forecasting future
defense and defense procurement spending and the necessity of modesty in presenting
any such forecasts. Although the present research has revealed some opportunities
to improve our estimates of Chinese and Indian defense spending using unclassified
sources and data, it may be that other approaches―employment of decisionmaking
models or arms race models, for example―also could help to illuminate some of the
factors that go into defense spending decisions.42<br><br>
Finally, an important technical issue that was beyond the scope of the present
effort is how to construct a “market basket” of defense goods to provide a better basis
for PPP-based conversion of local currency units to U.S. dollars. This is an important
methodological issue for consideration in future research.<br><br>
In closing, we stress the need for additional empirical research to further illuminate
and bound the many uncertainties associated with estimating and forecasting
Chinese and Indian defense and defense procurement spending. We also note a need
to better understand and model the factors that are likely to drive future Chinese
and Indian defense spending decisions, including the many strategic and domestic
“wild cards” that could affect the future trajectory of Indian and Chinese defense and
defense procurement spending.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">CHAPTER SIX Conclusions and Implications</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Two centuries ago, Edmund Burke advised a British parliamentarian: “Never plan the
future by the past.”1 His admonition recalls a more recent truism, often attributed to
Yogi Berra: “It’s dangerous to make predictions, especially about the future!”
Unfortunately, the four-dimensional assessment summarized in this report violates
both of these precepts. We have used data from the past and the present to make
forecasts about the future. Consequently, we should reiterate the caveats mentioned
earlier about the uncertainties surrounding our forecasts.<br><br>
The enormous uncertainty involved in a comparative assessment of the status
and performance of China and India 15 years from now can, in part, be reflected by
envisioning multiple scenarios on how past conditions might change drastically in the
future. To be sure, the scenarios―high-low and low-high pairings, optimistic and pessimistic
scenarios―are themselves based on data and trends from the past. Numerous
factors―political, economic, military, and both the domestic and international factors
mentioned earlier―have been largely ignored in assessing the four domains, and
these factors could substantially alter the forecasts for China and India in each of these
domains (perhaps less so for the demographic forecasts than for those of the other three
domains). Nevertheless, we have paired the respective high estimates for one country
with low estimates for the other, and conversely, in order to highlight the uncertainties
that might differentially impact the relative position of the two countries through
2025.<br><br>
With these cautionary thoughts in mind, our concluding comments return to
the key questions referred to at the outset: namely, in comparing India and China in
2025, Who will be ahead? Why? and By how much? More qualitatively, what are the
advantages and disadvantages that each country will have in the four domains of our
assessment?<br><br>


Demography<br><br>
India’s current rate of annual population growth is about twice that of China (1.55 percent
versus 0.66 percent); as a consequence, its population will equal China’s in 2025
(at about 1.4 billion) and exceed it thereafter. India’s population is projected to continue
increasing at least through 2050, while China’s will reach its maximum (about
1.5 billion) in 2032, declining thereafter.<br><br>
From the standpoint of effects on future economic performance, the changing
age distributions of each country’s population are more significant than their respective
sizes. A larger percentage of China’s population has been of working age (between 15
and 64), compared with India’s, for the past three decades. The percentage of China’s
population that is of working age will peak by 2012, declining sharply thereafter. By
contrast, the proportion of India’s population that is of working age will continue to
rise into the early 2030s, overtaking that of China in 2028. Hence, the potential labor
productivity of India’s total population will be increasing through the early 2030s and
will surpass that of China by 2031. Whether and to what extent this potential Indian
advantage is realized will depend on the employment opportunities available to India’s
rising cohorts of young workers, especially those for new entrants into the labor market.
Reflecting the changing age composition of their populations, China and India
will experience quite different changes in their respective dependency ratios, i.e., the
ratio of the over-65 and under-15 age cohorts to the prime working-age population.
China’s overall dependency ratio is currently nearly 39 percent. It will rise substantially
in the next two decades, as the number of elderly dependents increases more rapidly
than the number of child-age dependents decreases (the latter reflecting the effects of
China’s continued one-child policy).<br><br>
The pattern of India’s dependency ratios is quite different from China’s. Currently,
India’s aggregate dependency ratio is 48 percent, 15 percent higher than China’s. In
India, the elderly make up a lower proportion of the overall number of dependents
than in China, and this proportion is rising much more slowly in India than in China.
The proportion of India’s dependents that are young will increase slowly over the next
decade and then increase moderately thereafter.<br><br>
For the next two decades, India’s dependency ratio will remain above China’s,
although the margin between their dependency ratios will decrease, as China’s ratio
will be rising and India’s will be falling. After 2031, India will experience the advantage
of a lower dependency ratio, while China will face a sharply rising one. Moreover,
through 2025 and beyond, the changes in India’s dependency ratios, as with every
demographic indicator, are projected to be gradual, whereas changes in China will be
more rapid and therefore more socially stressful.<br><br>
Numerous other factors will affect the balance of advantages and disadvantages
resulting from these demographic conditions. These factors include health, education,
gender ratios, infrastructure, and migration. For example, China’s population is generally healthier than India’s, has the benefit of a more developed health care system, and
has more experience in containing the effects of communicable diseases. On the other
hand, China also has the impending burden imposed by a rising number and proportion
of older people, so China’s health costs can be expected to rise relative to those of
a lesser-burdened India. India’s younger population will be less prone to the costs of
communicable and noncommunicable diseases.<br><br>
China’s population has, on average, a higher level of literacy and is better educated
than India’s. The smaller cohorts entering China’s labor force in the 2020C2025 period
will be more educated than the larger ones in India, providing an advantage for China
and a challenge for India. To the extent that India successfully meets this challenge by
effectively investing in human capital, it may achieve an advantage through productive
employment of its growing pool of younger workers. Furthermore, the enhancement
of human capital can be propelled by the allocation and effective use of research and
development in government, business, and higher education, as discussed in Chapter
Four and later in this chapter under “Science and Technology.”<br><br>
Finally, while the data on gender ratios in both China and India are unreliable as
well as imperfectly comparable, both countries evidently have large gender imbalances,
ranging between 17 percent and 30 percent more males than females in younger age
cohorts. In China, the large imbalance is due to the combined effects of its one-child
policy as well as gender preference, while India’s equally large imbalance is due to the
single effect of gender preference. How each of the two countries will manage the
potential societal pressures arising from gender imbalance is both important as well as
unknown.
Whether India’s several demographic advantages―increasing numbers, younger
age cohorts, declining dependency ratios, smoother transitional trends, etc.―will add
up to a dividend or a drag on future growth depends on the extent to which productive
employment opportunities emerge from an open, competitive, innovative Indian economy.
A favorable answer to the question implies a substantial demographic dividend;
an unfavorable one would lead to a demographic drag resulting from high unemployment,
growing welfare burdens, and perhaps political unrest.<br><br>
Conversely, whether China’s several demographic disadvantages―rapid population
aging, peaking and then declining population size, rising dependency ratios,
increased gender imbalances, etc.―will create a drag or a dividend depends on whether
these demographic circumstances trigger compensatory stimuli to improve technology,
increase investment in human capital, or develop a more skilled and more productive
labor force. If the compensatory effects are sufficient, China’s demographic adversities
may result in no drag on, and obliquely provide a dividend for, China’s sustained economic
growth.<br><br>

Macroeconomics<br><br>
In a recent speech in Washington, D.C., India’s prime minister, Manmohan Singh,
observed,
There is no doubt that the Chinese growth performance is superior to Indian performance.
. . . But . . . there are other values which are more important than the
growth of the gross domestic product . . . the respect for fundamental human
rights, the respect for the rule of law, the respect for multicultural, multi-ethnic,
and multi-religious rights. (Singh, 2009)<br><br>
Notwithstanding the prime minister’s delineation of relative importance, the
focus of our macroeconomic assessment is GDP and its growth: past, present, and
prospective. Chapter Three occasionally touched on the “more important” values mentioned
by Singh, such as the rule of law, but the assessment has largely neglected them.
Moreover, our assessment of the economic growth performance of India and China
through the 2020C2025 period is moderately more favorable toward India than the
prime minister’s valid assessment of their respective performance up to the present.
The meta-analysis described in Chapter Three focused on forecasted growth of
GDP, capital, employed labor, and total factor productivity in the two countries through
2025. What is striking about these results is the remarkably narrow margins between
all of the paired China-India comparisons. The forecasted average GDP annual growth
rates for 2020C2025 are 5.7 percent for China and 5.6 percent for India. The corresponding
maximum GDP growth rates are 9.0 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively,
and their paired minimum growth rates are 3.8 percent and 2.8 percent.<br><br>
While our estimates for the Indian and Chinese growth rates are surprisingly
close to one another, the absolute size of the GDP gap in China’s favor would increase
by 2025 because of the three-to-one greater size of China’s initial GDP in 2010. Using
the mean growth rates from the meta-analysis results in GDP estimates of $6.5 trillion
for China and of $2.1 trillion for India in 2025, in constant 2000 prices at market
exchange rates.
In a further effort to reflect as well as to bound the uncertainties of the metaanalysis
forecasts, our assessment shows the GDP comparisons between India and
China that result from five differing paired scenarios of their respective high, low, and
average growth rates. As shown in Figures 3.5 and 3.6 of Chapter Three, only in the
high-growth India/low-growth China scenario does India’s GDP in 2025 approach
China’s. Using PPP conversion rates, in this scenario India’s GDP reaches $12.3 trillion
in 2025, while China’s reaches $13.8 trillion. In the four other paired comparisons,
China’s GDP exceeds India’s by factors that range between two and six!<br><br>
In a further effort to glean information from the 27 studies included in the metaanalysis,
we grouped them into three separate clusters reflecting their different organizational
sponsorships: academic, business, and international agencies.<br><br>


As discussed in Chapter Three, the business cluster is distinctly bullish (optimistic)
about India’s growth prospects and, relatively, bearish (pessimistic) about China’s.
The average annual growth rates projected in the business cluster for the 2020C2025
period for China and India are 4.7 percent, and 6.3 percent, respectively. By contrast,
the two other clusters reverse this order. The academic cluster yields average growth
rates of 5.5 percent for China and 4.3 percent for India, while the internationalagencies
cluster shows average growth rate estimates of 6.8 percent and 6.2 percent for
China and India, respectively.<br><br>
Chapter Three presents several conjectures (hypotheses) to explain the sharp differences
among the clusters. For example, the business cluster’s strong growth estimates
for India relative to China perhaps derive from greater emphasis on a favorable business
environment resulting from the rule of law, protection of property rights, and
a democratic political system (this recalls the previously cited observations of Prime
Minister Singh about other, “more important” values). Other hypotheses are presented
in Chapter Three to account for the wider variance in estimates from the academic
cluster studies and the more favorable estimates for China’s growth from the business
cluster studies.<br><br>
Chapter Three concludes with our judgments about the India-China comparison
pertaining to seven qualitative factors touched on in the 27 pooled studies: democracy
and rule of law; IT and service skills, institutional stability; property rights; productivity
growth; foreign investments in and by each country; and infrastructure. We
conjecture that India has advantages in the first four of these, China in the next three.
Whether this will enable India to catch up to or exceed China’s “superior economic
performance”―to use Prime Minister Singh’s words―is arguable, as well as worthy
of further study.<br><br>
Science and Technology<br><br>
In comparing the status and prospects of science and technology in China and India,
we have focused on input indicators comprising both finance and human resources, as
well as two output indicators. The financial inputs consist of gross domestic expenditures
on R&D (GERD) as a percentage of GDP and its four components: R&D spending
by higher education (HERD), by business (BERD), by government (GOVERD),
and by private nonprofit institutions (PNPERD). The human resource inputs are doctoral
degrees in science and engineering, including engineering, life sciences, physical
sciences, computer science, mathematics, and agriculture.<br><br>
The output measures used are publications (i.e., articles published in refereed scientific
journals) and patents (especially triadic patents registered in the United States,
the European Union, and Japan). These outputs are, at best, incomplete and imperfect.
Many of the major effects of S&T inputs result in innovations, improvements in production and management processes, and more effective service delivery that are
reflected in operational efficiency but not in either patents or publications.
While recognizing the limitations of these metrics, the assessment in Chapter
Four uses them to compare India’s and China’s recent accomplishments and to develop
a simulation model for projecting each country’s future trajectory.
China is currently the world’s third-largest R&D spender, with an annual growth
rate of 18 percent since 2000. According to the OECD, China follows the United
States and Japan in total R&D outlays (GERD). The business component (BERD),
which may have the greatest early effects on productivity among the four components,
has increased from 0.25 percent of China’s GDP in 1996 to over 1 percent in 2006.
Since then, China’s GERD has increased in both absolute amounts and as a share of
the country’s GDP.<br><br>
India’s GERD represents 0.8 percent of its GDP, which is between one-third and
one-half that of China (depending, respectively, on whether market exchange or PPP
conversion rates are employed in comparing outlays in rupees and renminbi). India
plans to raise its R&D to 2.5 percent of GDP in the next several years, perhaps stabilizing
or slightly raising it still further through the 2025 period.<br><br>
As described in Chapter Four, China currently graduates 70 percent more engineers
than India annually (600,000 versus 350,000, respectively), although the two
countries’ data are imperfectly comparable. Apart from the reliability and comparability
of these numbers, it is also difficult to assess the quality of ostensibly similarly credentialed
engineers in the two countries. In a McKinsey Institute survey of 83 global
multinational businesses (McKinsey Global Institute, 2005), the companies expressed
their judgments of relative quality by saying they would hire only one in ten graduate
engineers from China, but one in four from India. The substantial difference in
inferred quality was ascribed to the Indian graduates’ greater hands-on experience, as
well as their better English-language and communication abilities.<br><br>
To forecast the trajectories of China’s and India’s S&T growth, the assessment
develops and applies a simulation model with the input variables mentioned above,
along with parameters for costs and outputs (in credentialed S&T graduates, as well as
publications and triadic patents per researcher). The model has been run with different
values for these parameters, sometimes basing them on current levels prevailing in
India and China and sometimes basing their values on current levels in South Korea
on the plausible, but uncertain, assumption that the cost and productivity parameters
realized by India and China during the next 15 years will converge toward those
prevailing in South Korea in 2008. The several scenarios covered by the assessment
include different combinations of these parameter values.<br><br>
Chapter Four describes a wide range of results from these scenarios. Whether
the bottom-line estimates for 2025 are represented by total numbers of full-time science
and engineering researchers, holders of doctoral S&E degrees, or numbers of
triadic patents or publications, the estimates for China exceed those for India by wide margins. For the simulation estimates of researchers and S&E publications in 2025,
China’s estimates exceed India’s by factors of 8 and 13, respectively. In the scenarios
in which we have adopted the McKinsey survey’s 60 percent discount on quality (i.e.,
employability) of China’s S&E doctorates to establish equivalence with India’s, the
margins decrease substantially: The numbers of doctoral degrees and their associated
triadic patents are, for researchers and S&E publications, respectively, 1.5 and 1.7 times
larger for China than for India.<br><br>
Defense and Procurement Expenditures<br><br>
As described in Chapter Five, our assessment of spending for defense and defense procurement
by India and China employs the basic budget materials published by both
countries in recent years to identify the detailed components as well as aggregate allocations
over the past decade in each country. These materials are supplemented by
other information sources to calculate the defense and defense procurement shares
represented in the respective GDPs of China and India, how these shares have evolved,
and the two countries’ plans and prospects for maintaining or raising these shares.2 To
establish comparability between China and India, we have made adjustments to allow
for differing definitions as to what each country includes within its defense spending
estimates. For example, China includes paramilitary forces’ expenditures in national
defense spending, while India does not. Both countries exclude expenditures on nuclear
weapons and delivery capabilities, although there is no presumption that the bilateral
omissions are equal.<br><br>
It is difficult to obtain reliable data on defense procurement from the official budgets
of both countries, but the difficulties are much more acute for China. More generally,
the gaps in China’s official data coverage are larger and more opaque than those
for India. In any event, the sequential approach that our assessment employs builds
upon the official data for both countries to enable us to make estimates of each country’s
total expenditures on defense and on defense procurement, and to express these as
shares of their respective GDPs.<br><br>
Forecasts of these expenditures through 2025 are made using two different methods.
The first method is based on a continuation of recent year-over-year real growth
rates of defense spending; the second is based on defense spending as a fixed share of
GDP, and linked to rising GDPs drawn from Chapter Three. The first method generates
higher forecasts than the second; indeed, the estimates of the first method probably would be politically and/or financially infeasible because of the excessively high
budget and GDP shares they would represent. Each of the two estimating methods
was used to generate three alternative results, depending on whether optimistic, pessimistic,
or moderate (“best”) assumptions are made.<br><br>
According to the first method, our “best” estimate for India’s defense spending
in 2025 is between $94 billion and $277 billion in constant 2009 dollars, depending
on whether market exchange rates or PPP conversion rates are used. The corresponding
“best” estimates for China’s defense spending in 2025 lie between $688 billion and
$1,258 billion. Our estimates of China’s defense spending in 2025 are between four
times and seven times those of India.<br><br>
As noted, the forecasts generated by the GDP-based, second method are appreciably
lower than those of the first method. For India, our “best” estimates of defense
spending in 2025 lie between $82 billion and $242 billion in constant (2009) dollars;
those for China are between $267 billion and $488. According to this method, China’s
defense spending would be between two and three times that of India in 2025.
Turning to defense procurement, we employ a method analogous to the first
method referred to above for estimating total defense spending: namely, initially deriving
for both China and India a 12.8 percent annual real growth of procurement spending
from the data for the decade preceding 2009 levels. On this basis, our “best”
estimates of defense procurement for India in 2025 are between $63 billion and
$186 billion in constant dollars, depending respectively on whether market exchange
rates or PPP rates are used to convert from rupees to dollars. The corresponding estimates
for China’s defense procurement spending in 2025 lie between $266 billion and
$486 billion in constant dollars. Procurement spending in China would, by 2025, be
about between 2.6 times and four times that of India.<br><br>
Implications<br><br>
It is worth repeating our early cautionary remarks about the abundant uncertainties
surrounding these estimates. While there may be an excess of skepticism in the observation
of Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson that “Wall Street indexes predicted nine
of the last five recessions,3 his ironic remark is nonetheless a useful reminder lest our
forecasts be taken too literally. Circumstances in India and in China may make our
forecasts for defense spending and defense procurement very different from what actually
ensues by 2025. Similar caution is warranted concerning our other forecasts for
the two countries’ demographics, economic growth, and scientific and technological
development.<br><br>

Although such forecasts are surrounded by uncertainties that could have large
effects on any or all of the four domains we have investigated, this does not imply that
these effects will change the positions of India and China relative to one another.<br><br>
With this in mind, and while acknowledging the uncertainties and the ample
grounds for caution in drawing conclusions, what can be said about the salient questions
raised at the outset about China and India’s relative advantages and disadvantages?
And can we answer the three questions, Who’s ahead? By how much? and Why?<br><br>
The demographic assessment indicates several distinct advantages for India. Its
population will continue to increase in size through 2025; the share of its population
that is of prime working age is growing rapidly and will continue to do so beyond
2025. Its currently high dependency ratio is decreasing rapidly, and this will continue
beyond 2025. In contrast, China’s population will grow at a slow and decreasing rate,
peaking several years after 2025 and declining thereafter. Its dependency ratios will be
rising in the 2010C2025 period, and the rising costs of health care for the elderly will
become an increasing burden. Gender imbalance is present in both countries but more
severe in China, constituting a further source of demographic stress.<br><br>
In sum, demographic changes are likely to be relatively more favorable to India
than to China. From a developmental standpoint, demographic changes will provide a
dividend for India and be a drag on the progress of China.<br><br>
The three other dimensions of our assessment reverse this balance.<br><br>
While the macroeconomic analysis in Chapter Three indicates that the average
annual growth rates of India and China may be about equal over the next 15 years,
the absolute difference between their respective GDPs is likely to increase in China’s
favor, simply because of the differences in starting points: China’s current GDP is
about three times larger than India’s.4 Whereas China’s GDP in 2007 was $1.4 trillion
larger than India’s, in 2025, the difference between their respective GDPs will jump
to $4.4 trillion, assuming both economies grow at the average annual rates shown in
Chapter Three. So, our macroeconomic comparisons are relatively favorable to China.
A similar pattern emerges in the assessments of science and technology and of
spending on defense and defense procurement, and for similar reasons. As with the
macroeconomic assessment, the substantially larger base that China starts from generally
results in higher absolute numbers for S&T outputs and for defense spending
and procurement through 2025. Thus, our assessments for these two domains show
distinct advantages for China.<br><br>
The uncertainties accompanying these assessments have been reflected in various
alternative scenarios―high and low, optimistic and pessimistic―that would significantly
alter the paired comparisons. From the standpoint of drawing policy implications
from our four-dimensioned comparisons between India and China, the several paired scenarios in each domain can be regarded as building blocks that can be used
by policymakers in China and India, as well as by policymakers in such third countries
as the United States and Japan.<br><br>
For example, in viewing the demographic prospects we have described, what are
the national policy choices (including fiscal and monetary policies, as well as educational
and health policies) that India can make to take full advantage of the potential
demographic dividend we have envisaged? By the same token, what are the national
policy choices that China can take that will avert or modulate the potential demographic
drags we have described?<br><br>
From the perspective of United States and other third countries, the alternative
paired scenarios can serve as building blocks to identify and construct states of the
paired China-India world in 2025 that appear more and less favorable to the United
States or other third countries. For example, among the alternative S&T simulations,
which scenarios appear most favorable to the United States, and can such scenarios be
encouraged through foreign policy, alliance policy, or foreign trade and investment
policies?<br><br>
An important implication of such a building-block approach is that, by adopting
suitable policies, the respective countries (i.e., India, China, and the United States as a
prominent “third” country) may be able to affect the likelihood that one or another of
the alternatives materializes, thereby altering the balance of advantages and disadvantages
in the long-term, multifaceted competition between China and India.<br><br>
Explicating the specific policies and their effects in altering our forecasted outcomes
is worth further investigation, as well as beyond the purview of this study. That
said, it is reasonable to suggest the following proposition: Prospects for India to pursue
policies that will enhance its competitive position vis-à-vis China may be better than
the opposite prospects for China. India’s political-economic system entails at least a
moderately greater degree of economic freedom compared with China’s, and therefore
India’s environment may be more conducive to entrepreneurial, innovative, and inventive
activity.5 <br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">Appendix A Meta-Analysis of Economic Growth in China and India</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The first step in the meta-analysis involved collecting pertinent and accessible studies
done between 2000 and 2008 addressing economic growth in China and India
through the 2020C2025 period. The major sources consulted for the search included
publication indexes, LexisNexis, and Internet search engines. This search yielded an
initial pool of 47 studies.<br><br>
The second step identified a subset of 27 studies that had the requisite data from
India and China to permit their comparative assessment for the 2020C2025 period.
Twenty studies were excluded because of incomplete or otherwise insufficient data for
the two-country comparison.<br><br>
The third step required drawing data from each study to make calculations of the
recent and out-year rates of growth of GDP, employment, capital, and total factor productivity,
either directly from the study or indirectly using incremental capital/output
ratios, or a Cobb-Douglas production function, or a growth-accounting methodology.
Twenty-seven of the 32 studies met these criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis.
In the fourth step, these 27 studies and the corresponding descriptive statistics on
GDP and factor growth rates, means, minima, maxima, and variances were arrayed
into three separate groups or clusters of studies as follows:<br><br>
 academic authors and institutions<br><br>
 business organizations (e.g., Goldman Sachs, PricewaterhouseCoopers, McKinsey)
 international financial institutions (e.g., the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, the Asian Development Bank).<br><br>
This step included comparisons of the descriptive statistics across the three clusters
of studies, and highlighting their similarities and differences.
In addition to the descriptive statistics, and the comparisons across the three clusters,
the text discussion of the meta-analysis includes more detailed discussion of 17 of
the 27 papers included in the meta-analysis.<br><br>
Figure A.1 summarizes the successive steps.<br><br>
